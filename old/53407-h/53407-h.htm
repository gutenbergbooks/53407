<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dave Porter's Return to School</span>" is a
complete story in itself, but forms the third volume
in a line issued under the general title of "Dave
Porter Series."</p>

<p>In the initial volume of this series, entitled
"Dave Porter at Oak Hall," I took pleasure in introducing
to my readers a typical American lad, of
strong moral qualities, and told of many of the
things which happened to him during a term at
an American boarding school of to-day. Such a
school is a little world in itself, and Dave made
both friends and enemies, and aided one weak
and misguided youth to a realization of his better
self.</p>

<p>The great cloud over Dave's life was the question
of his parentage. His enemies called him "a
poorhouse nobody," which hurt him to the quick.
At length he made a discovery which led him to
begin a search for his missing relatives, and in the
second volume of this series, entitled "Dave Porter
in the South Seas," we followed the lad on a most
unusual voyage, in a quarter of our globe but little
known. Here Dave met his uncle, and learned

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>

something of himself and his father and sister,
which pleased him immensely.</p>

<p>In the present volume the scene is shifted back to
Oak Hall, where Dave goes to finish his preparation
for college. His friends are still with him,
and likewise his enemies, and what the various
students do I leave for the pages that follow to relate.
In all his trials Dave stands up for what is
honest and true, and in this his example is well
worth following.</p>

<p>Again I thank the many young people who have
taken an interest in my efforts to amuse and instruct
them. I hope this volume may prove to
their liking and do them good.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
<span class="small">AT THE RAILROAD STATION</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Here</span></span> comes the train, fellows!"</p>

<p>"I hope Dave Porter is on board."</p>

<p>"He will be, and Ben Basswood too. Ben wrote
to me that they were coming to-day."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Dave will be glad to get back to
Oak Hall, Lazy?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" returned Sam Day, a big, round-faced
youth, with a shock of curly hair hanging
over his forehead. "Didn't we have fine times
when he was here last term?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" Maurice Hamilton paused to
glance at the train that had rolled into the Oakdale
station. "There they are, sure enough!
Hurrah!"</p>

<p>The train had come to a stop and a dozen or
more passengers alighted. In the crowd were two
boys, each carrying a dress-suit case. Both were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>

tall, well-built, and manly-looking. The one in the
lead had a face full of merriment and earnest eyes
that were rather out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>"Dave!" cried Maurice Hamilton, rushing up
and catching the youth addressed by the hand.
"You don't know how glad I am to see you!"</p>

<p>"Same here, Shadow," responded Dave Porter,
and gave the other boy's hand a squeeze that made
the lad wince.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Dave! I want to use that hand
again!" cried Shadow, as he was familiarly called.
"Not so hard."</p>

<p>"And how are you, Lazy?" went on Dave Porter,
turning to the other boy on the platform.
"Active as ever?" And he smiled brightly.</p>

<p>"No, it has been dead slow since you and Roger
and Phil went away," answered Sam Day. "How
are you, Ben?" he added, to the second youth from
the train. "I hope you've come back to stir things
up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave will stir 'em up, don't you worry,"
replied Ben Basswood. "He feels like a two-year-old
colt since&mdash;well, you know," he added, in a
lower voice.</p>

<p>"Any one would," responded Sam Day, heartily.
"My, but what a trip you must have had to the
South Seas!" he added, to Dave. "Wish I had
been along!"</p>

<p>"Every one of our crowd has been wishing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

that," said Shadow Hamilton. "When you're
settled down, and have time, you must tell us all
about it, Dave."</p>

<p>"I certainly will. Have you seen anything of
Phil and Roger yet?"</p>

<p>"They are coming to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Good. All the others here?"</p>

<p>"All but Polly Vane and Luke Watson. Polly
had to go to his aunt's wedding, and Luke had to
go around by way of Albany, on business for his
father. But the whole crowd will be on hand by
the end of the week."</p>

<p>"And what of Gus Plum and Nat Poole and
that crowd?" asked Ben Basswood, with a shade
of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are around, as lordly as ever. But
say, wasn't Plum taken down when he heard that
Dave had found some relatives and was rich! He
wouldn't believe it at first; said it was a fake."</p>

<p>"But it is true," cried Ben Basswood, his face
glowing. "Dave's folks are rich. I don't know
but that Dave is the richest boy at Oak Hall now."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, let us talk about something else,"
said Dave, blushing in spite of himself. "Where's
the carryall?"</p>

<p>"Here you are, gents!" cried a voice from the
end of the platform, and Jackson Lemond, the
driver from Oak Hall, appeared. He got down
on one knee and made a profound bow to Dave.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>

"Hope I see you well, Lord Porter," he went on,
humbly.</p>

<p>"Lord Porter?" queried Dave, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Sam Day, quickly. "Some
of the fellows told Horsehair you were a real, live
lord now, and he believes it."</p>

<p>"But I am not," cried Dave, and burst out
laughing. "Up with you, Horsehair, or you'll
get your knee dirty."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes, sir," answered the driver, nervously.
"Will&mdash;er&mdash;will Lord Porter sit on the
front seat, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A lord always drives himself," answered
Shadow Hamilton, with a grin. "Horsehair,
you'll have to sit on the back spring."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;" The driver of the
carryall paused. "Any more boys?"</p>

<p>"Look here, fellows," interrupted Dave, throwing
his dress-suit case on the top of the carryall.
"I like fun as well as anybody, but making out I'm
a lord is&mdash;well, it's something I don't like. Even
though my folks may have a little money I want
to be just as I used to be."</p>

<p>"Ain't you no lord?" gasped the carryall driver.</p>

<p>"Of course not&mdash;I'm a plain, everyday American
boy."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be switched! Them young gents
told me as how you was a real lord, an' was coming

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

to the school with four colored servants, an' a
whole lot more."</p>

<p>"And now Dave has spoiled it all," said Shadow
Hamilton, with a ponderous sigh. "Puts me in
mind of a story I once heard about a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yarn No. 1," interrupted Ben. "I thought
you'd begin to tell 'em as soon as we arrived. You
have 'em bottled up, and unless you pulled the cork
now and then I suppose you'd explode."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of another story,
about a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait till we are on our way to the Hall," cried
Sam Day. "All in!" And one after another the
schoolboys piled into the big carryall which was to
take them to Oak Hall. The turnout was just
about to start when there came a cry from the
other end of the station, and two youths appeared,
each loudly dressed, one somewhat after the manner
of a dude and the other in the style of a sport.
Each carried a small parcel, showing he had come
down to the town to do some shopping.</p>

<p>"Gus Plum and Nat Poole!" whispered Ben,
and his face fell. "I hope they don't want to ride
with us."</p>

<p>"That is what they are going to do," answered
Dave. "I am sorry myself, but it can't be helped."</p>

<p>"Jump in if you are going along," cried the Hall
driver.</p>

<p>"Who have you got?" sang out Gus Plum,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>

rather roughly. He came closer with his companion
and stared at those in the carryall.
"Humph!"</p>

<p>"How do you do, Plum?" said Dave, politely.
He knew Gus Plum to be the bully of the school,
but he had determined to be perfectly fair to all.</p>

<p>"Humph!" murmured the bully again. "Got
back, eh?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"Going to cut a fearful swath, I presume," said
Nat Poole, who was the bully's close crony.</p>

<p>Dave's face flushed. He had anticipated trouble,
but had not expected it to come so soon. A
sharp answer came to his lips, but he suppressed it
and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Don't start in now, Plum!" cried Ben. "If
you are going to the Hall say so and get in."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the Hall when I feel like it," growled
the bully. It was plain to see that he was in an
unusually bad humor.</p>

<p>"Well, we are not going to wait for you to make
up your mind," said Shadow Hamilton. As we
shall learn later, he had good reasons for counting
Gus Plum his enemy. "Are you going, or are you
not?"</p>

<p>"See here, Hamilton, you can't boss me!" roared
the bully. "I'll get in when I please."</p>

<p>"The carryall has got to wait for us," added

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>

Nat Poole, maliciously. "Dr. Clay said we could
come back in it."</p>

<p>"Then come on," said Sam Day.</p>

<p>"We are not through with our errands yet,"
answered Gus Plum, and winked in secret at his
crony.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;and the carryall has got to
wait till we are through," added Nat Poole,
quickly.</p>

<p>"How long?" asked Dave, looking sharply at
Plum and Poole.</p>

<p>"Oh, about half an hour," answered the bully,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"This is a shame," muttered Sam Day.
"Horsehair, can't you come back for them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered the driver.</p>

<p>"Then off we go!" cried Shadow Hamilton.
"I'd rather ride without them anyway," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Hi! stop!" roared Gus Plum. "If you drive
to the Hall you won't be back for an hour and a
half or more. You've got to wait for us."</p>

<p>At this bold announcement there was silence all
around. The students in the carryall looked at
Dave, as he was their natural leader.</p>

<p>"There are four of us who want to get to the
Hall without unnecessary delay," said Dave,
steadily. "Either you can go along now, or wait
till Horsehair comes back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the talk," came promptly from Dave's
chums.</p>

<p>"So you are going to play the master, are you?"
blustered Gus Plum. "Going to rule the roost,
eh? and make everybody bow low to you,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, Plum. I merely
wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! You've talked soft to me before,
and soft to Nat, too! I suppose you think
now you have money you can do anything here.
Well, it don't go&mdash;not with me anyway, and I want
to give you fair warning right now, at the very
start. I want you to understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plum, don't talk so loud, you are drawing a
crowd," whispered Ben. "Dave is all right, and
you know it."</p>

<p>"Humph! I want him to understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plum, listen to me," said Dave, leaning out of
the carryall and facing the bully squarely. "I intended
to have a talk with you later, but since you
are so insistent we may as well have it out right
now. When it was decided that I should come
back to Oak Hall I made up my mind to do my
best to keep out of trouble and stick closely to my
lessons. I also made up my mind to steer clear of
you, and Nat Poole, and all the others of your
crowd, and I was going to ask you to leave me
alone. I want absolutely nothing to do with any

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>

of you, and I don't want any of you to go around
talking behind my back, as you have been doing
in the past. You know I could do some talking on
my own account if I wanted to, but I prefer to keep
silent. Now then, are you willing to meet me on
those terms or not?"</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"That is no answer."</p>

<p>"You can't bully me."</p>

<p>"You are the bully and always have been, and
you know it."</p>

<p>"That's the truth," said Sam Day.</p>

<p>"Plum, you've got to take a back seat, and the
sooner you do it the better off you'll be," added
Shadow.</p>

<p>"Exactly what I say," was Ben's comment.</p>

<p>"All against me, just as you always were!" cried
Gus Plum, savagely. "But never mind! Just
you wait, that's all!" And he shook his fist as he
backed away.</p>

<p>"You're a set of sneaks!" murmured Nat Poole,
as he too retreated. But he was careful to speak
in such a low tone that nobody in the carryall understood
him.</p>

<p>"I don't want to ride with you; I'd rather walk,"
went on the bully.</p>

<p>"I'll come back for you two," said the driver, as
he took up the reins again. "Git up there!" he
cried to his team and snapped his whip. "Looks

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

to me like there was trouble in the air," he continued,
glancing first at the students left behind and
then at those in the carryall.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are right," answered Dave,
soberly.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">SOMETHING OF THE PAST</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Once</span></span> again Dave Porter was brought face to
face with the troubles which he had hoped had
been put behind him forever. He had expected
to have the best kind of a time on returning to Oak
Hall, and here were his old enemies, Gus Plum
and Nat Poole, ready to do all in their power to
make his schooldays miserable.</p>

<p>To those who have read "Dave Porter at Oak
Hall" Dave needs no special introduction. In
that volume was related how the boy was found
when a little child wandering along the railroad
tracks just outside of the village of Crumville, and
turned over to the poorhouse authorities. Every
effort to establish his identity failed, and when he
grew up he was taken in by a broken-down college
professor, Caspar Potts, who had turned farmer.</p>

<p>The old professor did what he could for the
youth, but his farm was mortgaged to a hard-hearted
money lender, Aaron Poole, the father of
Nat Poole, just introduced. Aaron Poole would
have sold the old man out had not aid come from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

an unexpected quarter. There was an automobile
accident, and Dave succeeded in saving the life of
a little girl, Jessie Wadsworth. For this the
Wadsworth family were very grateful, and when
it was learned that Caspar Potts was one of Mr.
Oliver Wadsworth's former college professors, the
rich manufacturer took the old professor to live
with him, and also took care of the mortgage.
Then, for his bravery, and because Dave reminded
him of a dead son, Mr. Wadsworth resolved to
send the youth to a boarding school and give him a
thorough education.</p>

<p>Oak Hall was the institution selected, an ideal
place of learning, located not a great distance from
the town of Oakdale, in one of our New England
States. The buildings were substantial and surrounded
by beautiful grounds sloping down to the
Leming River. Stately oaks grew on the grounds
and in that vicinity, giving the school its name.</p>

<p>Dave had but one boy friend in Crumville, Ben
Basswood, who also went to Oak Hall, but the lad
was not slow to make other acquaintances, some of
whom became his closest chums. Among the number
were Roger Morr, the son of a United States
senator; Phil Lawrence, whose father was a ship-owner;
Joseph Beggs, usually called Buster because
he was so fat; and Sam Day and "Shadow" Hamilton,
already introduced.</p>

<p>For a time all went well and the poorhouse boy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>

was happy. But then came trouble with Gus Plum
the bully, and with Nat Poole, who also became a
student at the Hall. Poole told everybody that
Dave was a "poorhouse nobody," and Plum
taunted him, with the result that there was a fight,
in which Dave came off the victor. But this only
angered the bully the more, and he vowed to "get
square" sooner or later.</p>

<p>"I'll take it out of the poorhouse whelp," he
said to Chip Macklin, a small youth who was his
toady, and laid his plot with care. But the plan
miscarried, and when Dave learned the truth he
gave Chip Macklin such a talking to that the small
boy resolved to have nothing more to do with the
bully. Macklin turned over a new leaf, and was now
hailed as "a pretty decent sort of chap" by those
who had formerly despised him. Then Plum did
something which got Shadow Hamilton into serious
trouble, stealing a collection of valuable postage
stamps belonging to the master of the school,
which poor Shadow had hidden when he was sleep-walking.
This base action was also brought to
light, and the bully came near being expelled from
the Hall.</p>

<p>The question of his parentage was ever in
Dave's mind, and when he gained what he thought
was a clew he followed it up as promptly as possible.
An old sailor named Billy Dill declared
that he knew Dave or somebody that looked exactly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>

like him, only older. This unknown individual
was on an island in the South Seas, and the youth
arranged to visit that portion of the globe in one
of the ships belonging to Phil Lawrence's father.
Phil, and Roger Morr, went with him, and also
Billy Dill, the necessary funds for the trip being
furnished by Oliver Wadsworth.</p>

<p>As related in the second volume of this series,
"Dave Porter in the South Seas," the voyage of the
<i>Stormy Petrel</i> proved to be a decidedly strange
one. Fearful storms were encountered, and a portion
of the crew, led by a dishonest supercargo and
a mate, tried to run off with the vessel, leaving
Dave, his chums, the captain, and some others, on
an uninhabited island. But in the end the vessel
was retaken, and Dave reached the place for which
he was bound.</p>

<p>A great and happy surprise awaited the youth.
He came face to face with a Mr. Dunston Porter,
who proved to be the boy's uncle. Mr. Porter
was rich and was wandering around the islands of
the Pacific looking for a treasure said to have been
buried by the natives years before. The uncle
told Dave that he was the son of a twin brother,
David Breslow Porter. Dave's mother was dead,
but there was a sister Laura, one year younger than
Dave. Mr. David Porter and his daughter Laura
were now in Europe, traveling for the former's
health. Dave had been stolen from his parents

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>

by a crazy nurse, and because of this Mr. Porter
never went anywhere without taking Laura with
him. There was a good deal of money in the
family, a fair share of which would rightfully fall
to Dave when he became of age.</p>

<p>As was but natural, Dave was impatient to meet
his father and his sister. He and the others journeyed
back to the United States, and various messages
were sent, to Mr. David Porter and to
friends at Crumville. Then Dave and his uncle
journeyed to the Wadsworth home, where they
were warmly received.</p>

<p>At first the message forwarded to Dave's father
in Europe brought no reply, but at last came back
an answer from the keeper of a hotel in Paris
where Mr. Porter and Laura had been stopping.
This said that the Porters had departed some weeks
before for an extended trip to Norway, after which
they expected to sail for New York, to which place
all mail was to be addressed. Where the two
travelers were at the present time there was no
telling.</p>

<p>"Dave, this is hard luck," said the boy's uncle,
on receiving the news. "I don't know what to do
except to wait."</p>

<p>"Can't we send letters to different cities in Norway?"
returned the youth. "I want to meet my
father and my sister so much!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we can try that," answered Dunston Porter,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>

and the letters were sent without delay; but so
far no answers had been received.</p>

<p>Oak Hall had opened for the fall term, and
after some discussion it was decided that Dave
should return to that school until some word was
received from his father. In the meanwhile Mr.
Dunston Porter became the guest of Mr. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>Outside of the fact that he was impatient to meet
his father and his sister face to face, Dave was
very light-hearted when he and Ben Basswood left
Crumville on their journey to Oakdale. Being a
"poorhouse nobody" was now a thing of the past,
and he felt relieved to think that no one could
again taunt him regarding his parentage. More
than this, he was now in the care of an uncle who
was kind and loving to the last degree, and he was
provided with all the money he needed, and it was
"his own money," as he told himself with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He had already met some of his chums since returning
from the South Seas&mdash;boys who had
stopped off at Crumville while on their railroad
journey to Oakdale. All had congratulated him
on his luck and wished him well.</p>

<p>But Nat Poole had not been happy over Dave's
good fortune. They had met at the local post-office,
and Poole had made some undertoned remarks
that did not please Dave in the least. As a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

matter of fact Nat Poole, even though fairly well-to-do
himself, envied Dave because of his riches.</p>

<p>"Wait and see how he tries to lord it over us
when he comes back," said Nat Poole to Gus Plum,
when the two met at Oak Hall. "I suppose he
will put on such airs there will be no living with
him. And he will do what he can to buy all the
other fellows over to him."</p>

<p>"He shan't lord it over me, or buy me over
either," answered the bully. His tone was very
bitter, because of the fact that his own position in
life seemed to be going down. His father had
lost money steadily during the past year, and it was
now almost a question whether Gus should continue
at school or leave and go to work.</p>

<p>"It made me sick to see how Crumville folks
bowed and smiled to him," went on Nat Poole.
"When he was nobody they wouldn't notice him&mdash;now
they tumble over each other to shake him by
the hand."</p>

<p>"But has he really got so much money?"</p>

<p>"They say so&mdash;but I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"Does he dress any better than he used to?"</p>

<p>"Hardly a bit better. If that uncle of his has
the rocks I guess he is miserly about using any."</p>

<p>"Then maybe Dave won't have so very much
spending money," said Gus Plum, his face brightening
a bit.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that. But I do

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

know it makes me sick to think he is coming here
to show off in front of all of us."</p>

<p>Gus Plum looked around cautiously. The pair
were in their dormitory and nobody else was within
hearing.</p>

<p>"Nat, we hung together last term and we had
better hang together this term too," he whispered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;against Porter and his
crowd?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll do that quick enough."</p>

<p>"We must find some way to throw him off his
high horse."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't want to get pinched doing it."</p>

<p>"We won't get pinched&mdash;if we do the thing
right."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to do anything that can be done to
make him eat humble pie."</p>

<p>"I owe him a whole lot&mdash;and so do you," continued
the bully of Oak Hall, bitterly. "Don't
you remember how he treated us at the athletic
contests, and down at the boathouse? It makes
me boil every time I think of it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and the tricks he and his cronies played
on us," returned Nat Poole. "Gus, I'll do anything&mdash;so
long as we are not caught at it."</p>

<p>"I'd like to fix him so he'd be disgraced before
the whole school." Gus Plum's voice sank to a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can we do it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we can," was the answer.</p>

<p>And there and then, two days before Dave got
back to Oak Hall, these two unworthies plotted to
disgrace him and leave a smirch upon his fair
name.</p>

<span class="small">DAVE'S RETURN TO OAK HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">The</span></span> carryall containing Dave and his friends
soon left Oakdale behind and was bowling swiftly
along over the smooth highway leading to Oak
Hall. The boys were all inside, leaving the driver
to manage his team in any way that suited him.
Usually they loved to torment Horsehair, as they
called him, but now they had other matters on their
minds.</p>

<p>"The same old Plum," said Ben, with a sigh.
"Doesn't it make one weary to listen to him?"</p>

<p>"Better try to forget him, and Nat Poole too,"
answered Dave.</p>

<p>"That is easier said than done," said Shadow
Hamilton. "Which puts me in mind of a story.
There was once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is bound to tell 'em," came, with a groan,
from Sam Day.</p>

<p>"Never mind; go ahead, Shadow," said Dave.
"Sam said you could start in after we were on
board, and I'd rather hear a story than discuss
Plum and Poole."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were talking about forgetting Plum. One
day a boy got into his mother's pantry and stole
some preserved plums. When the plums were
found missing the boy's mother caught him and
cuffed his ears in good style. Then the boy went
outside and his chum told him to stop crying.
'Forget that your mother cuffed you,' said the other
boy. 'I ain't thinkin' of that,' answered the boy
who had stolen the plums. 'Then stop crying.'
'I can't.' 'Why not?' asks the other boy. 'Because
the plums was hot an' I kin feel 'em all along
my throat yit.'" And at this anecdote a smile
passed around.</p>

<p>"I suppose football is being talked about," observed
Ben, after a brief pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, some of the boys are playing already," answered
Sam Day. "I have been waiting for
Roger to get back. He was captain of our eleven
last season, you'll remember."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you were right tackle."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose we'll get another challenge
from the Rockville Military Academy?"</p>

<p>"Sure we will," burst out Shadow. "They'll
want to wipe out the defeat of last year."</p>

<p>"Gus Plum has organized a football team of his
own," observed Sam. "He has got Poole and a
lot of new students in it. They call themselves the
Arrows, and one boy told me they were going to
have suits with arrows embroidered on them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way, what of Chip Macklin?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"He is around and as bright as a button," answered
Sam. "It is simply wonderful what a
change there is in that chap since he cut away from
Plum."</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the apples!" cried out Ben, as the
carryall made a turn in the road. He pointed to a
tree in a field loaded with the fruit. "Wish I had
one."</p>

<p>"You won't get any there," declared Shadow.
"That's Mike Marcy's field and he keeps any number
of dogs."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" burst out Sam, feeling down
under the seat. "If you hadn't spoken I should
have forgotten them entirely." He brought out a
bag containing a dozen big red apples. "I bought
them while we were waiting for the train. Here,
boys, help yourselves." And he passed them
around.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sam," said Dave, as he bit into one
of the apples. "This is fine." And the others
said the same.</p>

<p>Each had his story to tell, and Sam and Shadow
listened with eager interest while Dave told of his
long trip across the Pacific, and his many adventures
since he had left the academy.</p>

<p>"Sounds almost like a fairy tale," declared Sam.
"I'd like to see something of the world myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The carryall made another turn and came in
sight of the river, dotted here and there with small
craft. Along the shore grew some bushes and a
few trees.</p>

<p>"I see some of the fellows are out rowing," observed
Dave. "I'd like to go out myself some
day, before it gets too cold."</p>

<p>The carryall was passing a point where the road
was considerably higher than the surface of the
stream. Dave had bitten into a second apple, that
proved to be wormy. Now he leaned out of the
carryall and sent the fruit spinning down through
the bushes toward the river.</p>

<p>"Hi! hi!" came back a voice from the shore
below. "Who hit me?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, I must have hit somebody!" exclaimed
Dave. "I didn't mean to do it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded the driver,
pulling his team in.</p>

<p>"You needn't stop," answered Ben. "Dave
threw an apple away, that's all."</p>

<p>"I've got to fix the harness&mdash;there's a strap
loose," went on Lemond, and leaped to the ground.
He was at work when a man appeared, climbing up
the river bank through the bushes. It was Job
Haskers, one of the assistant teachers at the
Hall, the only instructor the students did not
like.</p>

<p>"Ha! so some of you played a trick on me, eh?"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

fumed Job Haskers, as he emerged upon the road
and strode toward the carryall. "Nice doings, I
must say!"</p>

<p>"Did the apple hit you, Mr. Haskers?" asked
Dave, mildly.</p>

<p>"Did it hit me? I should say it did, right on
top of the head."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"So you threw it, Porter. I am amazed that
you would dare do such a thing."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were down there&mdash;in fact, I
didn't know anybody was there."</p>

<p>"A likely story," sneered the teacher, who was
very often hot-headed and unreasonable.</p>

<p>"I am telling the truth, sir," and Dave's face
flushed.</p>

<p>"I cannot go out for a quiet stroll by the river
side but somebody must hit me in the head with a
hard apple," growled the instructor. "Have you
just arrived?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You ought to be more careful of what you are
doing."</p>

<p>"As I said before, I didn't know anybody was
down there."</p>

<p>"I presume you didn't want to see me." The
teacher turned to all of the boys. "Where did you
get those apples?" he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I bought them in Oakdale," answered Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't been stopping at some orchard on the
way?"</p>

<p>"You may ask Mr. Cassello, the fruit man, if
you don't believe me," and Sam drew himself up.</p>

<p>"Well, be more careful after this, or you'll hear
from me!" answered Job Haskers, and strode off
down the road in a thoroughly bad humor.</p>

<p>"Phew! but we are catching it all along the
line," was Ben's comment. "First Plum and
Poole, and now Haskers. Wonder what we'll
strike next?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to hit anybody," said Dave.
"How peppery he is!"</p>

<p>"And he thinks we took the apples from some
orchard," added Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, such things have happened," observed
Ben, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of another story," said
Shadow. "There was a little boy, and his mother
had been away nearly all day. 'Mamma,' said he
when she came home, 'can I have two apples?'
'Won't one do?' she asked. 'No, I want two.'
'Very well,' said his mother. Then she saw him
go to the basket and get one apple. 'I thought
you wanted two,' she remarked. 'Oh,' he
answered, 'I had the other one this morning!'"</p>

<p>Sam burst out laughing and so did the others.
"I see the drift of that," said Sam. "You haven't

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

forgotten when we went to Japlet's orchard after
apples&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the bull cornered Sam," said Ben. "Don't
forget that, Sam."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Haskers is hard on us, and he
had no business to call Dave down as he did, just
for throwing the apple into the bushes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has found out something about that
ram and how he got up in his room," whispered
Ben, and then a laugh went up, in the midst of
which the driver started up the carryall and the
journey to Oak Hall was resumed.</p>

<p>Dave was on the watch, to catch his first sight of
the school. They were passing through a bit of
woodland. Now they made a turn, and rolled out
in front of a broad campus lined on either side with
a boxwood hedge. At each corner of the campus
were clumps of monstrous oaks, the leaves of which
had just begun to turn, and at the entrance were
more of the same kind of trees.</p>

<p>The school itself was a thoroughly up-to-date
structure, of brick and stone, laid out in the shape
of a broad cross. The classrooms, the office, and
the dining hall and kitchen were on the ground
floor and the dormitories and private bedrooms
and the bathrooms were above. Off to one side of
the campus was the gymnasium, and down by the
river were a boathouse and a row of bathing
houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah! Here we are at last!" cried Dave,
and his heart gave a bound.</p>

<p>"Let us give 'em the old song, boys!" cried Sam
Day, who was a good singer, and he at once started
up the following, to the tune of "Auld Lang
Syne":</p>

<div class="center">

<p>They sang with a will, and when they had
finished they added the old academy cry:</p>

<p>"There's Dave Porter and Ben Basswood!"</p>

<p>"Hello, Dave, how do you feel after traveling
across the Pacific?"</p>

<p>"Bring any of those South Sea Islanders with
you?"</p>

<p>"Mighty glad to see you back, old man!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>So the cries rang on, as Dave and the others left
the carryall. Dave was surrounded, and half a
dozen tried to shake hands at once.</p>

<p>"We want you on the football team, Dave,"
said one.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to know you found your folks," added
another.</p>

<p>"You've come back to stay now, haven't you?"
asked a third.</p>

<p>Dave shook hands all around. As the school
song had it, the place felt just like home. For the
time being his heart was lighter than ever, and his
return to Oak Hall filled him with more pleasure
than words can express.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">IN THE DORMITORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">It</span></span> took Dave several days to settle down and
during that time he heard but little from Gus Plum
and Nat Poole, who prudently kept their distance,
awaiting the time when they might do Dave some
injury.</p>

<p>During those days Roger Morr and Phil Lawrence
arrived, both hale and hearty from their trip
with Dave across the Pacific. The senator's son
had spent two days in Washington with his father,
while Phil had been settling up some affairs with
his parent regarding the cargo of the <i>Stormy
Petrel</i>.</p>

<p>"This is certainly like old times," remarked
Roger, as the crowd sat in their dormitory. "I
hope we have as much sport as we did last
season."</p>

<p>"We will have, don't worry," answered Phil.</p>

<p>"Provided Job Haskers doesn't stop us," said
Buster Beggs, who was lying across one of the
beds. "Tell you what, boys, he is sharp on this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>

term. Yesterday he caught me writing on the
boathouse wall and he made me write 'chirography'
five hundred times."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a good way to improve your handwriting,"
answered Dave, with a smile. "I've
done a little of that sort of thing myself."</p>

<p>"He kept me in two hours yesterday, when I
wanted to play football," growled Shadow Hamilton.
"It was a burning shame."</p>

<p>"But what did you do?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much. Nat Poole was coming
down the aisle and he made a face at me. I
happened to stretch out my leg and Poole tripped
and went flat. Then old Haskers said it was all
my fault."</p>

<p>"And what did Poole say?" asked Sam, with
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, he threatened to punch me good&mdash;but he
didn't do it. He started to quarrel after school,
but Gus Plum called him off."</p>

<p>"Well, that was queer," observed Dave. "Generally
Gus is out for a fight."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," came from
Shadow. "A little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Narrative No. 206," broke in Sam.</p>

<p>"You shan't keep me from telling it," went on
Shadow, calmly. "A little man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How small?" asked Roger, with a wink at the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that hasn't anything to do with it. A little
man once met another man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was the other man small, too?" questioned
Phil, seriously.</p>

<p>"Never mind if he was or not. A little man
once met another man who had a big bulldog with
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was the color of the bulldog?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"What color? See here, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you tell a story, Shadow, give us the details,
by all means. Was he white or black, red or
yellow? Or maybe he was cream-color, or sky-pink,
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;er&mdash;he was a regular bulldog color.
Well, this man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sort of a brownish blue, with a dash of crimson
and violet," suggested Phil.</p>

<p>"He was a regular common, everyday bulldog,
only he was very big and very savage."</p>

<p>"Muzzled, of course," came from Roger.
"Bulldogs always are."</p>

<p>"I saw one once that wasn't," added Buster
Beggs.</p>

<p>"Some of 'em wear silver-plated muzzles," observed
Sam.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say this bulldog had a silver-plated
muzzle?" demanded Dave, turning to
Shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who in creation said he had a muzzle?" cried
the would-be story-teller. "I said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you did, Shadow dear," said Luke
Watson, who sat on a low stool with his banjo in
his lap, tuning up. "Don't let them sidetrack you,
or the bulldog either."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is this," said Phil, impressively.
"Were those men white or black?
That may have a very important bearing on the
moral of the tale."</p>

<p>"See here, if you don't want to hear the
story&mdash;&mdash;" began Shadow, half angrily.</p>

<p>"We do! we do!" came from several at once.</p>

<p>"We are dying for you to finish," said Roger.
"Now start up again. A small bulldog once came
along, leading a big, fierce man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not right," broke in Buster. "A small
bulldog once met another bulldog leading a bulldog-colored
man who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Great Csar! That's as bad as the story of
the canner," broke in Sam. "The canner can eat
what he can and what he can't he can can, can't
he?" And a laugh went up.</p>

<p>"I am going to tell this story if I die for it,"
cried Shadow. "A small man&mdash;remember that&mdash;met
another man&mdash;remember that&mdash;with a big,
fierce bulldog&mdash;remember that. The small man
was afraid, but he didn't want to show it, so he said
to the man with the bulldog: 'Is that dog a valuable

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>

animal?' 'Yes,' says the other man. 'Well,
don't let him loose, then.' 'Why not?' 'Because
I don't like dogs and I might hurt him.' Now
there's the story, and you've got to swallow it
whether you want to or not."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a song," said Luke
Watson. "Sam, you know it, and can join in,"
and he began, accompanying himself on the banjo:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i1">"I love him, I love him,</span>
      <span class="i2">He's down at the gate;</span>
      <span class="i1">He's waiting to meet me</span>
      <span class="i2">No matter how late.</span>
      <span class="i1">He loves me so truly,</span>
      <span class="i2">It fills me with joy</span>
      <span class="i1">To hug him and kiss him&mdash;</span>
      <span class="i2">My poodle dog, Floy!"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song rang out clearly and sweetly, and when
the verse was repeated the others joined in. But
then came a knock at the door, and Jim Murphy,
the big-hearted monitor, appeared.</p>

<p>"Hush! not so loud," he whispered, warningly.
"Haskers is coming upstairs." And then the
monitor disappeared again.</p>

<p>"I know what that means," said Luke, and rising
he put his banjo away in a closet. "He
stopped me before&mdash;he shan't have the chance to
do it again."</p>

<p>The boys had scarcely settled themselves when
Job Haskers appeared and gazed sharply around

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

the dormitory. He found all the boys either writing
or studying.</p>

<p>"Who is making that noise up here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>To this there was no reply.</p>

<p>"If I hear any more of it I shall punish everybody
in this room," added the assistant teacher,
and went out again, closing the door sharply after
him.</p>

<p>"He's in an elegant humor to-night," was Phil's
comment. "Must have swallowed some tacks, or
a cup of vinegar."</p>

<p>"He ought to be taken down a peg," said
Shadow, who had not forgotten how he had been
kept in. "I wish we could do something like last
term when we got Farmer Cadmore's ram up in
his room and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it," cried Buster. "Only it won't do
to try the same joke twice. We'll have to think up
something new. Polly, give us an idea."</p>

<p>He turned to Bertram Vane, who sat at a table,
trying to write a composition. Bertram was very
girlish in appearance, hence the nickname.</p>

<p>"Please don't bother me now," pleaded Polly.
"I want to finish this composition."</p>

<p>"We want some idea to work off on Haskers.
Open up your knowledge box, Polly," came from
Phil.</p>

<p>"Really I can't," returned the girlish student.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

"I am writing a composition on Bats, and I
want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Baseball bats?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"No, no, living bats. Their habits are very interesting,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Polly has solved the question for us!" exclaimed
Dave, and began to grin. "Just the thing!
Polly, have you written much yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't the chance, with so much talking
going on."</p>

<p>"Then you had better change your subject, for I
don't think Mr. Haskers will want to read a composition
on Bats to-morrow&mdash;not if the plan goes
through."</p>

<p>"What is the plan?" came eagerly from several
of the others.</p>

<p>"I just happened to remember that one of the
boys over at Lapham's farm has a cage full of bats
that he caught last week. He said he would sell
them for fifty cents. Perhaps Mr. Haskers would
be pleased to have them presented to him."</p>

<p>"Whoop! We'll get those bats!" shouted
Phil.</p>

<p>"And put them in his room," added Shadow.</p>

<p>"And as we are modest we won't say where the
gift came from," remarked Sam.</p>

<p>The plan was approved by everybody, even
Polly Vane smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"Bats are very curious creatures," he observed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

"They fly in people's hair, and they can make one
very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>The crowd talked the matter over, and it was
decided to get the bats at once, if it could be done.
As Dave knew the boy who had the creatures he
was commissioned to go after them, taking
Shadow and Roger along.</p>

<p>It was still early, so the three lads had no difficulty
in getting out of the academy building.
They did not, however, dare to ask for permission
to leave the grounds, and so stole across the campus
to the gymnasium building, back of which they
vaulted the boxwood hedge. Close at hand was a
road leading through a patch of woods to the Lapham
farm, whither they were bound.</p>

<p>"We have got to watch out, when we are coming
back," said the senator's son, as they trudged
along. "We don't want to get caught by Haskers,
or Dr. Clay either."</p>

<p>"When we return one of us can go ahead and
see if the coast is clear," answered Dave. "It will
be all right unless somebody has been playing the
spy on us."</p>

<p>"I didn't see anybody."</p>

<p>"Neither did I, but I believe they are going to
enforce the rules more strictly than ever this season."</p>

<p>It was a cool, clear night, with hundreds of stars
twinkling in the sky. They knew the road well,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>

having traveled it many times before. They left
the woods behind, and then came out on a small
hill, below which was the farm for which they were
bound.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Laphams are in bed," said
Shadow. "Some farmers go to bed mighty early."</p>

<p>"I know it, especially when the days are short,"
answered Dave. "Well, if the boy's asleep we'll
have to wake him up. I guess he'll be glad enough
to sell the bats. He said his mother didn't want
him to have them around."</p>

<p>"I see a light in the house," said Roger, as they
drew closer. "Have they a dog?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then we can go right up to the door and
knock."</p>

<p>The three students entered the lane leading up
to the farmhouse. They saw a light flash up in
one lower room and then appear in the next.
While they were gazing it suddenly disappeared,
leaving the farmhouse in total darkness.</p>

<p>"Evidently they are just going to bed," said
Dave. "Hurry up, before they get upstairs."</p>

<p>He broke into a swift walk and the others did
the same. They were close to the front porch of
the house when they heard a shrill cry from within:</p>

<p>"John! John! Wake up! There is somebody
in the house!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
<span class="small">SOMETHING OF A MYSTERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Did</span></span> you hear that?" asked the senator's son,
as he and his companions came to a halt on the
porch of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>"I did, and there must be something wrong,"
answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are burglars around," said
Shadow. "I must say, I don't like this," he continued,
nervously.</p>

<p>"There was a burglary in Oakdale night before
last," said Dave. "I heard Swingly the janitor
telling about it."</p>

<p>All three now heard a commotion in the farmhouse.
There was the slamming of a back door,
and then somebody came leaping down the inside
stairs.</p>

<p>"Where is he, Jane?" they heard in a man's
voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I heard the back door shut,"
answered a woman's voice. "And I saw a
light."</p>

<p>"I don't see anybody," went on the man of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

house, and lit a match. Soon he had a lamp in his
hand, with which he went to the back door.</p>

<p>"Did you leave the wash-shed window open?"
he called out.</p>

<p>"No," returned Mrs. Lapham. "I shut it
tight."</p>

<p>"It's open wide,&mdash;and the back door is unlocked,"
went on her husband.</p>

<p>"Any thieves around, pop?" came in a boyish
voice.</p>

<p>"Better git the gun," advised another boy, Bob
Lapham, who had the bats for sale.</p>

<p>The man went out in the yard, lamp in hand.
As he did this, the three students walked around to
meet him.</p>

<p>"Hello, what do you want?" demanded John
Lapham, halting and staring at his unexpected visitors.
"Were you in my house?" he continued,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, sir, we just came up," answered Dave.
"We want to buy those bats your son has for sale."</p>

<p>"Did you see anybody around here&mdash;I mean
going out just now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"We saw a light, in the parlor and the sitting
room," said Roger. "It went out just as we came
up."</p>

<p>"Then my wife must be right. Somebody has
been in the house. I must take a look around."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The two Lapham boys now came out, and the
whole crowd looked around the farmhouse and the
stable near by. Not a soul was in sight anywhere.</p>

<p>"Whoever he was, he has gotten away," said the
farmer, soberly. "I hope he didn't steal anything."</p>

<p>He and his sons were but partly dressed and they
went in the house again, followed by the students,
who were curious to learn if anything had been
taken.</p>

<p>"I brought home a lot of stuff from my aunt's
house yesterday," explained John Lapham. "She
is breaking up housekeeping and gave us her silverware
and such. I had it all in the box yonder."</p>

<p>He set down the lamp and threw aside the cover
of the box he had pointed out. One look inside
and he gave a groan.</p>

<p>"The silverware is gone!"</p>

<p>"All of it?" queried one of his sons.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the cut glass fruit dish is gone too!"</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Lapham had dressed and now
she came down. At the news she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, John, you must get after those burglars!"</p>

<p>"Can there have been more than one?" asked
Dave.</p>

<p>"I think I heard two men moving around, but I
am not sure," said the woman.</p>

<p>Another search was made by the students, while
the farmer and his sons hastily donned the rest of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

their clothing. Then John Lapham brought forth
a shotgun.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get that stuff back," said he, determinedly.
"You say the burglars didn't go out
by the front road?"</p>

<p>"We didn't see anybody," answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Then they must have taken to the lane that
leads down to the river."</p>

<p>"Let us go down and see, pop," said Bob Lapham,
eagerly.</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and after a few words Dave
and his chums went along. For the time being the
bats were forgotten.</p>

<p>"This may get us into a mess at the Hall," whispered
Shadow, as they hurried along. "In telling
the news Mr. Lapham will be sure to mention us."</p>

<p>"Well, that can't be helped, and we'll have to
get out of it the best we can," answered Dave.
"It's our duty to help capture those burglars, if it
can be done."</p>

<p>The whole party walked down the lane leading
to the river, which, at this point, overflowed a portion
of the Lapham meadow. The farmer had
brought along his barn lantern.</p>

<p>"I see something!" cried Dave, as a bright object
caught his eye. But it was only a battered tin
can, which caused everybody to utter a short laugh.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the water's edge.
Here they saw where a rowboat had been hauled

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>

up on the bank. In the mud and grass they made
out the footsteps of two men, but that was all.</p>

<p>"Have you had a boat up here in the last few
days?" asked Dave of the farmer.</p>

<p>"Ain't had a boat here in a month."</p>

<p>"Then this must have been the burglars' boat."</p>

<p>"I think so." John Lapham gave something of
a sigh. "They got a good start."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we don't know which way they went,"
added one of his sons.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what the stuff that was
stolen was worth?" asked the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Fifty or sixty dollars, maybe more."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think any professional burglars
would bother to take such a small amount," was
Shadow's comment. "Maybe they are worthless
characters from around here."</p>

<p>"Like as not," answered the farmer. "Maybe
the same rascals that robbed Jerry Logan's house
at Oakdale. They got about fifty dollars' worth
there too."</p>

<p>They looked out upon the river as best they
could, but not a craft of any kind was in sight, nor
could they hear any sound of rowing. The farmer
drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>"I'm stumped," he declared.</p>

<p>"You'd better notify the authorities," suggested
Roger.</p>

<p>"Won't do a bit o' good. The constable ain't

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>

worth his salt, and the justice ain't no good either.
If I want to find those burglars I've got to do it
myself."</p>

<p>"Have you a boat?"</p>

<p>"No, but I can get one in the morning, and I'll
get some of the neighbors to help me."</p>

<p>There seemed nothing more to do just then, and
the whole party returned to the farmhouse. Then
Dave explained what he had come for to Bob
Lapham.</p>

<p>"All right, you can have the bats," said the farm
boy. "They are in the barn. But what do you
want of them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we were going to use them for something&mdash;but
perhaps we won't now," said Dave, and
handed over the amount to be paid. Soon the bats
were brought forth, in a battered mocking-bird
cage. They were a round dozen in number.</p>

<p>"See here, Bob, don't say anything to anybody
about our coming here," whispered Roger, slipping
an extra quarter into the farm boy's hand. "We
are not supposed to be away from the Hall, you
know."</p>

<p>"All right, I won't say anything."</p>

<p>"And keep your brother and your father quiet
too,&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best. I don't know your names
anyway."</p>

<p>"None of them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good enough. Now we are off. Good-night."</p>

<p>The boys were about to turn from the farmhouse
when John Lapham called them back.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Dave, and a
sudden strange sensation took possession of him.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking that things look rather
queer," went on the farmer, pointedly.</p>

<p>"In what way?" demanded Shadow.</p>

<p>"How was it that you didn't knock on the front
door when you first came here?"</p>

<p>"We heard a noise and we listened to find out
what it meant," answered the senator's son.</p>

<p>"It seems mighty queer to me," said the farmer,
doggedly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Mr. Lapham?" demanded
Dave, his face beginning to burn.</p>

<p>"It's queer you should come here this time of
night just to get some bats that ain't any good to
nobody."</p>

<p>"Well, that is what we came for and nothing
else."</p>

<p>"You're sure you don't know anything about
that robbery?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Lapham, do you take us for thieves?"
cried the senator's son, hotly.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that; I said it was queer."</p>

<p>"You know we haven't the stolen stuff."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you are sure you don't know anything
about those other chaps?" mused the farmer.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," answered Dave. "All we saw
was the light just before it went out, and heard the
noise."</p>

<p>"It is preposterous to think we would come here
to take your silverware," went on Roger, warmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, pop, they are all right," said Bob Lapham.
"All the students at Oak Hall are honest fellows."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," was the grim answer.
"They don't seem to be honest when it comes to
getting in our orchards."</p>

<p>"I have never been in your orchard," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Nor I," added Shadow.</p>

<p>"Nor I," affirmed the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Last season I had about half of my fruit
stolen."</p>

<p>"Well, some of it was taken by the boys from
the military academy, you must remember," said
Bob Lapham, who evidently wanted to help the
Oak Hall students all he could.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>"We are totally innocent," asserted Shadow.
"I don't see how you can suspect us."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" demanded the farmer.</p>

<p>Shadow hesitated and then straightened up.</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed to tell you. It is Maurice
Hamilton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is yours, young man?" went on John
Lapham, turning to Dave.</p>

<p>"David Porter."</p>

<p>"And yours?"</p>

<p>"Roger Morr."</p>

<p>"Morr, eh? Do you belong around here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I come from near Hemson."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then you ain't related to Mr. Samuel
Morr, of Bainridge?"</p>

<p>"I am. He is my uncle."</p>

<p>"Are you Senator Morr's son?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The farmer's face changed slightly.
"Well, that makes a difference. I know Mr.
Samuel Morr quite well," he continued, but did not
add that Roger's uncle held his note for two hundred
dollars, and he wished the same renewed for
three months. "Of course, if you are Senator
Morr's son it is all right, and I am sure you didn't
have anything to do with the robbery."</p>

<span class="small">JOB HASKERS'S BAD NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">After</span></span> that the farmer questioned the boys
further concerning their visit to his home and at
last drew from the students their whole story.
When they acknowledged that they wanted to play
a joke on Job Haskers he smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"I know that man," he said. "He wanted to
buy some apples and potatoes here once, to ship to
some of his folks, and he was so close and mean
about it, I wouldn't sell him anything. Go ahead
and play your joke on him, and I won't say anything
about it."</p>

<p>"And you won't say anything about our visit
here?" questioned Roger, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not a thing&mdash;unless, of course, it becomes absolutely
necessary to do so."</p>

<p>"You're a brick, Mr. Lapham," cried Dave,
much relieved. "We'll do all we can to help you
catch those burglars."</p>

<p>"That we will," added Shadow.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we'll never catch them, boys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
constable here is no good, and I don't know where
to look for them," responded the farmer.</p>

<p>A few minutes later found the students on the
return to Oak Hall, Dave carrying the cage full of
bats.</p>

<p>"That was a narrow escape," was Shadow's comment,
as they hurried along to make up for lost
time. "I thought sure he'd report the matter to
Dr. Clay."</p>

<p>"To think we should run into a burglary!" declared
the senator's son.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the same fellows robbed Mr. Lapham
who committed the robbery at Oakdale?"</p>

<p>"It is more than likely. I hope they catch the
fellows."</p>

<p>It did not take the three youths long to reach the
academy grounds. Roger slipped in ahead and
was gone five minutes.</p>

<p>"Hurry up&mdash;the coast is clear!" he whispered,
on coming back. "The side door is open and nobody
on the stairs, so far as I could see."</p>

<p>They ran across the campus, Dave with the cage
full of bats still in his hand. They had almost
reached the door when they heard it slam shut.
Then the key was turned and the bolt shot into
place.</p>

<p>"We're locked out!" whispered Shadow, in consternation.</p>

<p>"Let us try the other doors," suggested Dave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>They did this, making the entire round of the
school building. Every door was shut and
locked, even that to the kitchen addition being
tight.</p>

<p>"Now we are in a pickle and no mistake,"
groaned the senator's son.</p>

<p>"I suppose the other fellows have gotten tired of
waiting for us and gone to bed," said Shadow.
"We've been away an hour and a half longer than
we expected."</p>

<p>"One thing is certain, we must get into the Hall
somehow," said Dave. "We can't stay out here
all night."</p>

<p>"Let us go around under one of our windows,"
said Roger.</p>

<p>They were soon under a window of Dormitory
No. 12. It was open from the top to admit the
fresh air. All was dark in the school building and
they had only the starlight to guide them.</p>

<p>Gathering up a handful of pebbles, Dave threw
them at the window and Roger and Shadow followed
suit. At first nobody paid attention to this.
Then the window was raised from the bottom and
the head of Phil appeared.</p>

<p>"Hello you!" he called softly. "Thought you
were going to make a night of it."</p>

<p>"We were delayed," answered Dave. "All the
doors are locked. Can't you open one for us?"</p>

<p>"I'll see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil's head disappeared, and then Sam Day and
Buster Beggs showed themselves.</p>

<p>"Got the bats?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Here, in this cage."</p>

<p>"Good enough!"</p>

<p>The boys below waited fully five minutes after
that. Then Phil appeared once more.</p>

<p>"It's pretty risky to open a door," he announced.
"Mr. Dale is below, and so are Pop Swingly and
one or two others. I think they are watching for
somebody."</p>

<p>"I hope they are not watching for us," returned
Shadow, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"No, I think they are looking for some other
fellows who went out."</p>

<p>"Here's a fishing line," said Sam. "You can send
up the bats on that, if you like. Then if you are
caught, they won't find out what you were after."</p>

<p>"A good idea," answered Dave, and tied the
cage to the end of the line. Soon the bats were
hauled up to the dormitory and stowed away in a
safe place.</p>

<p>"I wish we could go up on the line too," said
Shadow, wistfully.</p>

<p>"We can get a ladder from the barn and go up,
if you say so," suggested Roger. "Only, what
will we do with the ladder afterwards?"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Dave_began_to_mount"></a>
<img src="images/p050.jpg" alt=""  width="323" height="500" />
<div class="topspace1"></div>
<div class="caption">Dave began to mount the improvised rope.&mdash;<i>Page 51.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ladder would expose us," said Dave.
"I've got a plan. Take the bed sheets and make a
rope of them, and we'll haul ourselves up somehow."</p>

<p>The charm of this idea took instantly, and those
in the dormitory set to work to knot together five
or six sheets without delay. Then one end was
held fast while the other was dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Will it hold?" questioned Roger. "We don't
want to break our necks."</p>

<p>"I'll try it," said Dave, and began to mount the
improvised rope hand over hand, bracing his feet
against the brick and stone building as he did so.
As the youth was a pretty good athlete he had
small trouble in gaining the top and hopping into
the dormitory. Then Shadow came up, followed
by the senator's son, and the bed sheets were hauled
back and separated. The sheets were somewhat
mussed from the strange usage, but that was all.</p>

<p>The other boys wanted to know what had kept
Dave and his companions so long, but it was too
late to relate the whole story.</p>

<p>"We can tell it in the morning," said the senator's
son. "Just now let us see how the land lies
for getting the bats into old Haskers's room."</p>

<p>He and Dave tiptoed their way out into the hallway,
which was dark saving for a faint light near
a bathroom door. Not a person was in sight, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

a faint murmur of voices came from a room
below.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he will have his door locked," said
Dave. "He learned his lesson when he had the
trouble with the ram."</p>

<p>But to their satisfaction they found the door to
the assistant teacher's bedroom unlocked. They
listened and heard Job Haskers breathing heavily.</p>

<p>"He is sound asleep," whispered Roger.</p>

<p>"Let us put the key on the outside first," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>This was done, and then the two boys went back
for the cage of bats. The other students in the
dormitory wanted to see the fun, and half a dozen
went out into the hallway. In order that they
might not be seen and recognized, the light was extinguished.</p>

<p>"I am going to loosen the bottom of the cage
and then throw the whole thing on Haskers's bed,"
said Dave. "Stand ready, somebody, to lock the
door."</p>

<p>"I'll do that," answered Phil.</p>

<p>With caution the door was opened for a little
over a foot. Then Dave loosened the bottom of
the cage and shook the bats up. As they fluttered
around he threw cage and all directly on the teacher's
bed. Then the door was quickly closed and
locked and the key thrown down into the lower
hallway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. Then from
Job Haskers's room there arose a frightful
shriek.</p>

<p>"Help! Get away! What is this? Oh, my
eye! Get away, I say! Oh! oh! Save me! I
shall be killed! Get away!" And there followed
a series of yells and thumps and the overturning of
a chair and a table.</p>

<p>"He is enjoying himself&mdash;I don't think!" cried
Roger, with a chuckle. "Oh, say, listen to
that!"</p>

<p>"Back to the room, or we'll be discovered,"
warned Phil, and back they ran with all speed.</p>

<p>But the strange commotion had aroused the
whole Hall, and dormitory doors were opened on
all sides and students rushed out to see what was
the matter. Then Dr. Clay appeared, garbed in
a dressing gown. Andrew Dale, the first assistant
teacher, ran up from below.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this unseemly noise?"
thundered the good doctor. "Make a light, somebody."</p>

<p>Several lights were lit. In the meantime the
noise in Job Haskers's room continued. The second
assistant was having a hot fight with the bats.
The creatures banged him in the face, whizzed past
his ears, caught in his rather long hair, and practically
scared him out of his wits. He made wild
passes at them with his hands, dancing around in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the meanwhile, and in his bewilderment brought
down a steel engraving covered with glass with a
tremendous crash.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers must be going crazy!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is a burglar in his room!"</p>

<p>"Look out that you don't get shot!"</p>

<p>"I know what's the matter!" cried one fun-loving
student. "He must have the hydrophobia.
He said a dog tried to bite him a couple of days
ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, if he has gone mad I don't want
him to bite me!" shrieked one of the younger
students.</p>

<p>"Better chain him up and pour water on him!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers!" thundered the doctor, rattling
the doorknob. "Mr. Haskers! What is the
matter? Open the door."</p>

<p>But the noise was so fearful that no attention
was paid to the request. Then came another
crash, as the assistant teacher picked up a book, let
it fly at the bats, and sent a big pane of glass in the
window into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>This was too much for Dr. Clay. Satisfied that
something dreadful was going on, he put his shoulder
to the door and burst it open. As he did this,
something whizzed past his ear and made him
dodge.</p>

<p>"Stop! Don't throw anything at me!" he
called. "What in the world does this mean?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what it means!" roared Job Haskers,
who was so bewildered he scarcely knew what
he was saying. "Get out of here! Oh, my eye!
That's the third time I've been hit!" And he
made another sweep at his invisible enemy. Then,
as Dr. Clay backed into the hallway, the teacher
followed him and ran down the corridor like one
gone crazy.</p>

<p>By this time somebody was bringing a lantern,
and Andrew Dale had armed himself with a club.
The doorway to Job Haskers's room had been left
wide open and the sounds within had suddenly
ceased. With caution Andrew Dale peered inside.</p>

<p>"I do not see anything out of the ordinary," he
announced, looking around with caution.</p>

<p>"Maybe the bats have cleared out!" whispered
Roger to Dave.</p>

<p>"I hope they have. See, the window is open
from the top, and the bottom glass is broken out."</p>

<p>One after another, teachers and students
crowded into the room. Phil spied the battered
bird cage resting near the foot of the bed, and, in
secret, passed it to Dave, who handed it to Sam.
The latter was close to the window, and threw the
object out as far as he could. In the meantime the
excitement continued.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything."</p>

<p>"Better look for robbers!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe somebody is in the closet."</p>

<p>The closet was searched, but nothing out of the
ordinary was discovered. The students in the
secret looked for bats, but every one of the creatures
had taken its departure for parts unknown.</p>

<span class="small">A CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Mr. Haskers</span></span>, I would like to have you explain
this affair," said Dr. Clay, after the excitement
had died down.</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;have you got them?" faltered the
assistant teacher, who was still much bewildered.</p>

<p>"Got what?"</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;the things that were in my
room."</p>

<p>"I can find nothing in your room, and neither
can Mr. Dale."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing? absolutely nothing, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing out of the ordinary. Did you
have a nightmare?" And the worthy master of
the Hall looked sternly at his assistant.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I don't think I did. I woke up suddenly,
sir, and something flew by my head. Then
something hit me in the face and got caught in my
hair, and after that I&mdash;er&mdash;I was hit half a dozen
times."</p>

<p>"Ahem! This is certainly extraordinary. You
are sure you weren't dreaming?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think I was, sir."</p>

<p>"Was your window open when you went to
bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from the top."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a night bird flew in."</p>

<p>"There must have been half a dozen of
them."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it was, it is gone now. You
had better go back to bed. You can push the chiffonier
against the broken-out window if you wish,
to keep out the cold air. Boys, I want you all to
retire. We'll have the window and the broken
lock mended in the morning."</p>

<p>The doctor turned and waved the students away,
and one after another they departed for their
dormitories. Then he followed Job Haskers into
the latter's bedroom. The door was closed and
what was said was not heard by the others.</p>

<p>"Well, that was certainly one on Job Haskers,"
chuckled Roger, as he followed Dave to bed.</p>

<p>"And I doubt if he ever learns what was the real
trouble," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"By the way, I didn't see Gus Plum and Nat
Poole," said Phil. "It is queer they didn't come
out of their room."</p>

<p>"Maybe they weren't in the building!" cried
Sam. "Mr. Dale was watching downstairs for
somebody."</p>

<p>"I am not going to bother my head about it,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>

announced the senator's son, as he began to get
ready to jump into bed, having disrobed in part before
playing the joke on the teacher. "The walk
made me tired."</p>

<p>"I am tired, too, and sleepy," said Shadow.</p>

<p>"Ditto here," announced Dave.</p>

<p>All of the students had gone to their dormitories,
and once more quiet settled over the Hall.
The light that had been lit was extinguished, and
one after another the boys hopped into bed and
tucked the covers in around them.</p>

<p>"Great hambones! What's this!" came, an instant
later, from Phil, and he began to wiggle from
head to foot.</p>

<p>"Adam's tombstone, but this is fierce!" cried the
senator's son and sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>"I should say it was!" declared Dave, as he also
thrashed around. "I can't stand this. Who put
something in my bed?"</p>

<p>"I didn't!" declared Buster.</p>

<p>"Nor I!" declared one after another of the occupants
of the dormitory.</p>

<p>Once more the boys got up, and the light was
again lit. It was soon discovered that a mass of
burdock burs had been placed in the beds of Phil,
Roger, and Dave. None of the other beds had
been touched.</p>

<p>"This is an itchy joke and no mistake," said
Dave, with a sickly grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Puts me in mind of a story," began Shadow.
"At a school&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No stories just now!" cried Dave. "I want to
know who did this?"</p>

<p>"I saw some burdock burs yesterday," said
Polly Vane. "Little Sammy Bilderman had
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he gave them to Nat Poole," declared
Chip Macklin. "I saw him do it."</p>

<p>"That explains it!" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"Explains what?" asked several of the others.</p>

<p>"Why Poole and Plum didn't show themselves
while the racket was going on in Haskers's room.
They came in here and fixed us up."</p>

<p>"It must be so," said Phil, "for I know my bed
was all right before."</p>

<p>Dave leaped noiselessly to the door and threw it
open. Nobody was outside, but he heard a door
at a distance close softly.</p>

<p>"Somebody was out there. He just ran off," he
declared.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Roger, and tiptoed his way
into the semi-dark hall, followed by Dave and Phil.
They made their way to the door of the dormitory
in which Poole and Plum belonged. They heard
a rustle and the faint creaking of two beds.</p>

<p>"We've found them all right," whispered the
senator's son. "The question is, what shall we do
in return?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait," advised Dave. "We've had enough
for one night. Let us get to bed."</p>

<p>The others were willing, and so they returned to
their own room. The burs were cleared away,
and in a few minutes more all of the lads were in
the land of dreams.</p>

<p>In the morning, on entering the classroom, the
students found Job Haskers heavy-eyed and in anything
but a pleasant humor. He called one class
after another to order in a sharp, jerky voice, and
gave the pupils demerit marks upon the slightest
provocation. As a result Dave, Phil, and eight
other students suffered in their general average.</p>

<p>"How I wish Dr. Clay would get rid of him,"
sighed Phil.</p>

<p>"And get another teacher like Mr. Dale to take
his place," said Dave. All the boys loved Andrew
Dale, who was as pleasant as he was capable.</p>

<p>It was not until two days later that Roger met
Bob Lapham. The farm boy said his father had
heard nothing more of the burglars and the stolen
silverware, and had come to the conclusion that
little could be done in the matter.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," said the senator's son. "I do
hope he gets his stuff back some day."</p>

<p>Although Dave was out for fun and sport, it
must not be thought that he neglected his studies.
As my old readers know, he was a youth who put
his whole heart and soul into whatever he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>

doing, and this applied to his lessons as well as to
everything else. In the past he had kept close to
the top of his class, and he was resolved to retain
that position or do still better.</p>

<p>"I came to learn something," he said, more than
once. "I am not going to neglect my lessons, no
matter what is in the air."</p>

<p>"But you'll join our football team, won't you?"
asked the senator's son, who was looked upon as
the leader in that sport by nearly all the old football
players.</p>

<p>"I will if you want me to, Roger. But you
know I am not an extra good player. Baseball is
my game, not football."</p>

<p>"But we want you to play the position you took
last year, when you made that victorious run."</p>

<p>"Very well. What of the other fellows?"</p>

<p>"Ben will be quarter-back as before, and Phil a
half-back, and Sam right tackle. I haven't made
up my mind about the others yet, although I think
I'll try Shadow for center and Buster for guard."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the team Gus Plum has
organized?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, Dave, I think some of
his fellows play pretty good football," answered
Roger, in a low voice, so that no outsider might
hear him.</p>

<p>"Just what I think. Henshaw is a dandy quarter-back,
and Babcock makes a good, heavy tackle.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

We ought to have them on our team&mdash;if we are to
play Rockville."</p>

<p>"Well, I would ask them to join us, only if I do
that, Plum will say I am trying to steal his men
from him."</p>

<p>The next morning came a surprise. Roger received
a challenge from the Arrows to play a game
of football the very next Saturday afternoon. Nat
Poole delivered the paper, and his face had a superior
smile on it as he did so.</p>

<p>"Why, Poole, we are not in trim to play yet,"
said Roger. "We need more practice."</p>

<p>"Afraid to play us, eh?" sneered the aristocratic
youth. "I thought so."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid. Make it three weeks from
now and I'll accept."</p>

<p>"No, you must play this week or not at all. If
you won't play we'll challenge the Rockville
fellows."</p>

<p>With this declaration Nat Poole hurried away,
leaving the senator's son much worried. As Roger
had said, his team needed practice. They were all
good players individually, but team work is what
counts in a modern game of football. He went to
consult his friends.</p>

<p>"We can't do it," said Sam, shaking his head.
"Why, some of us scarcely know the new rules yet,
much less our signals."</p>

<p>"We need at least two weeks of good, snappy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>

practice," put in another of the players. "None
of us are hard enough yet."</p>

<p>"This is a plan to get us into a hole," declared
Dave. "If we back out Plum will challenge the
Rockville boys and make out that his eleven is the
representative one from this school. It's just like
one of his dirty tricks."</p>

<p>The boys talked the matter over a good hour,
and finally a vote was taken.</p>

<p>"I say play," declared Dave. "Let us practise
all we possibly can. If we are beaten we can immediately
send a challenge for another game on
the Saturday following."</p>

<p>So it was at last decided, although Roger, Phil,
and Sam were still doubtful. They declared it
was taking a big risk and that if they lost they
would never hear the end of it.</p>

<p>In the meantime Gus Plum was laughing in his
sleeve, as the popular saying goes, feeling certain
that Roger's eleven would not accept the challenge.
Three of the players who had formerly played on
the team of the senator's son had left Oak Hall,
and that meant the substitution of green hands
from whom it was not known what to expect.</p>

<p>"They'll crawl out of it," declared Nat Poole,
as he and the bully of the Hall and a student named
Jasniff talked it over. Jasniff was a newcomer at
Oak Hall, a fellow with a squint in one eye and a
manner that few of the boys cared to tolerate, although,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

strange to say, it pleased Plum and Poole.
Jasniff smoked, and played pool when he got the
chance, and so did they, and, in addition, the new
student was fond of drinking and horse races,&mdash;a
poor sort of a companion for any youth who
wanted to make a man of himself.</p>

<p>"You've got them dead to rights," said Nick
Jasniff. "They'll crawl, see if they don't."</p>

<p>"I'll give them until Thursday to accept," said
Gus Plum. "If they don't, I'll send a challenge to
Rockville on Friday."</p>

<p>"Will Rockville play us?" asked Poole. "They
may put up some sort of a kick."</p>

<p>"I'll let them know how matters stand," answered
the bully of the Hall, with a suggestive
wink. "If Morr's crowd won't play us, then we
are the representative team of the Hall, aren't
we?"</p>

<p>As the bully ceased speaking, Dave and Roger
walked up to the three other boys.</p>

<p>"Here's our answer to that challenge, Plum,"
said the senator's son, and held out a paper.</p>

<p>"I presume you decline to play us," sneered the
bully, as he took the note.</p>

<p>"On the contrary we take pleasure in accepting
the challenge," said Dave.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE RIVALS OF OAK HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">For</span></span> the moment after Dave made his announcement
there was a dead silence. The faces of Gus
Plum and his associates showed their disappointment.</p>

<p>"Going to play us, eh?" said the bully, slowly.</p>

<p>"You'll be beaten out of your boots," said Nat
Poole, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"That remains to be seen," answered Roger.
"We accept the challenge and we are here to arrange
all the details of the game."</p>

<p>A talk lasting nearly a quarter of an hour followed,
in which they went over such details as
seemed necessary. Plainly Plum was ill at ease.
He wanted to chose an umpire, referee, and linesmen
from outside of Oak Hall, but the senator's
son would not consent to this.</p>

<p>"I am satisfied to have Mr. Dale for umpire,"
he said. "And three of our head students can act
as referee and linesmen." And so at last it was
decided, but not without a great deal of grumbling.</p>

<p>"You won't win this time, Porter," remarked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

Nick Jasniff, as Dave and Roger were leaving.
"After this game you'll never be heard of again in
this school."</p>

<p>"'He laughs best who laughs last,'" quoted
Dave, and walked away, arm in arm with Roger.
Jasniff stared after him and so did Plum and
Poole.</p>

<p>"They really mean to play after all," muttered
Poole. "I was dead sure they'd decline."</p>

<p>"You never can tell what Porter will do,"
growled Gus Plum. "I'll wager he got Morr to
accept."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to wax 'em good and
hard," remarked Nick Jasniff. "And we ought
to be able to do that easily enough&mdash;with Henshaw
and Babcock on our side. Those two
fellows play as if they belonged to some college
eleven."</p>

<p>"Yes, I hope great things from Henshaw and
Babcock," answered the bully of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>When Roger and Dave returned to the members
of their own eleven they were asked how Plum and
his crowd had taken the acceptance of the challenge.
Then the coming game was discussed from
every possible point of view.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I'd almost rather beat Plum
than some outside team," remarked Phil. "He
deserves to be taken down."</p>

<p>"I don't like Nick Jasniff at all," said Dave,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

slowly. "In one way I think he is a worse fellow
than either Plum or Poole."</p>

<p>"He has a bad eye," said Sam. "It's an eye I
don't trust."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," added
Shadow. "Now don't stop me, for this is brand-new&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Warranted?" queried Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, warranted. Two Irishmen and a Dutchman
got into an argument and when they separated
all three were in bad humor. The next day one of
the Irishmen met the other Irishman. 'Sure, Pat,'
says he. 'I don't loike that Dootchmon at all, at
all.' 'Nayther do I,' answered the other Irishman.
'He has a bad eye, so he has,' went on the
first Irishman. 'That's roight, he has&mdash;an' I gave
him that same this very marnin'!' says the other
Irishman."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the new joke!" cried Roger,
and a general laugh arose.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose all we can do is to start practice
and keep it up until the day for the match comes,"
said Dave, after the laughter had subsided.</p>

<p>"That's it," answered the senator's son. "We'll
do what we can this very afternoon."</p>

<p>The boys went to their classroom with their
heads full of the coming football contest. Roger
had already made up his eleven, largely from the
material of the season previous. But the boys

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

who had gone from Oak Hall left weak spots in
the line which it was next to impossible to fill.</p>

<p>Then came another set-back, which made Dave
and the others gloomy enough, and caused Gus
Plum and his associates to smile grimly to themselves.
Instead of remaining clear, a cold, dismal
rain set in that very afternoon and kept up for two
days. To practise on the football field was out of
the question, and all Roger's eleven could do was
to exercise in the gymnasium. Here there was
always some one of Plum's crowd to look on and
see whatever was being tried in the way of a trick
or a new movement.</p>

<p>"I hope it rains Saturday, too," grumbled Phil.
"We won't be able to make any kind of a showing
at this rate."</p>

<p>"It will be just our luck to have good weather
Saturday," sighed Shadow.</p>

<p>Even Dave was disheartened, but he did not
show it. Instead he did all the practising he could
in the gymnasium and helped Roger whip the
eleven into shape. As he had said, he did not care
for football as much as baseball, but he was resolved
to do his best.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning all the boys were up early,
to see what sort of weather they were going to
have. The sun was under a cloud, but by nine
o'clock it cleared up and a fine, warm wind from
the south sprang up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"That settles it, we have got to play," said Buster
Beggs.</p>

<p>"Let us go out and practise as soon as we can,"
said the senator's son, and called the eleven without
delay.</p>

<p>Of course the match had been talked over
throughout the school and even outside. As a
consequence, when the time came to play, a goodly
crowd had assembled on the football field. There
was cheering for both sides and the waving of a
good many Oak Hall banners. In the small stand
that had been put up sat Dr. Clay and about twenty
visitors.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything of Henshaw and Babcock,"
said Dave, looking over the field. "They
must be going to play."</p>

<p>"There they are, over in the corner, talking to
Plum and Poole," answered Roger, pointing with
his hand.</p>

<p>"They must be planning some new move,"
said Phil. "We'll have to watch out for
them."</p>

<p>Presently Babcock, a fine, sturdy player, came
forward, followed by Henshaw. Both were
frowning, and when Babcock said something to his
companion Henshaw nodded vigorously. Plum
and Poole came behind, and neither appeared
particularly happy.</p>

<p>The game was to be played under the rules of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

that year, with two halves of thirty minutes each.
When it came to the practice Roger's team did
what it could. The players were full of energy,
but the team work was not at all what it might
have been.</p>

<p>"Want to tune up!" sang out one looker-on, to
Roger. "Get together!"</p>

<p>"We are trying to," answered the senator's son.</p>

<p>Plum's eleven did much better in practice, working
in perfect harmony. Only Poole made
fumbles, for which the bully of the Hall upbraided
him roundly.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't howl at me," growled Poole. "I
am doing as well as you are."</p>

<p>At length the game was called and the two
elevens lined up. They were pretty well matched,
although Henshaw and Babcock stood out above
the others.</p>

<p>"Wish that pair were on our side," sighed
Roger. "Each of them has weight, wind, and
cleverness&mdash;just the things a good football player
ought to possess."</p>

<p>There was no time to say more. The toss-up
gave Plum's eleven the ball and a few minutes later
it was put into play and sent twenty yards into our
friends' territory. Then came a scrimmage and
the leather went back and forth rapidly. The
play was ragged, for neither side had as yet settled
down to hard work. There was no brilliant play,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

and when the ball was carried over the line by Henshaw
the applause was rather tame.</p>

<p>"An easy touchdown!"</p>

<p>"Now make it a goal."</p>

<p>This was not so easy, for the wind had freshened.
The ball sailed outside of the posts, so that
the Arrows received but five points.</p>

<p>Again the ball was put into play and now the
work on both sides became more earnest. Several
of Gus Plum's players became rough and Plum
himself tried to "spike" Dave with his shoe.
Dave gave the bully a shove that sent him headlong.</p>

<p>"A foul! Time!" was the cry.</p>

<p>"He tried to spike me!" cried Dave, hotly.</p>

<p>"I didn't!" roared the bully.</p>

<p>"He did&mdash;I saw it!" put in Roger.</p>

<p>"Have you spikes in your shoes?" demanded the
umpire.</p>

<p>"No," muttered Gus Plum, but his face grew
red.</p>

<p>The umpire made him show the bottoms of his
shoes. Each had a small spike in it&mdash;something
quite contrary to the rules, as all football players
know.</p>

<p>"Change your shoes at once, or get out of the
game," was the decision rendered, and Gus Plum
ran off the field with a redder face than ever.</p>

<p>The first half of the game closed with the score

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

12 to 0 in favor of Gus Plum's eleven. A safety
for Roger's team had been made by Dave, who saw
it was the only thing to do when crowded by Babcock,
Henshaw, and two others. The second
touchdown made by the Arrows came through
Babcock aided by several others.</p>

<p>"We could whip them if it wasn't for Babcock
and Henshaw," said Luke Watson. "Those two
chaps are dandy players and no mistake."</p>

<p>During the intermission it was seen that Gus
Plum was having another lively interview with
Babcock and Henshaw. But the two expert
players would not listen to the bully of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"Something is wrong in their camp, that's certain,"
was Phil's comment.</p>

<p>"Look here, if you say anything, I'll put you off
the team!" cried Gus Plum, to Babcock and Henshaw,
so loudly that many standing around could
hear him.</p>

<p>"All right, put me off if you wish," answered
Babcock sharply.</p>

<p>"I'll never play with you again anyway!" added
Henshaw. "I've done my best to-day, but this
ends it, if I never play again as long as I stay at
Oak Hall."</p>

<p>"You're out of it, both of you!" roared Gus
Plum, in a sudden rage. "Dawson, take Henshaw's
place, and Potter, you take Babcock's place.
I'll show you that I can run a team to suit myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," said Babcock, and turning on his
heel he left the field. Henshaw, without saying a
word, followed his friend.</p>

<p>All who witnessed the scene were curious to
know what it meant, but none of the other Arrow
players would explain. Soon it was time for the
second half of the game. Two of Roger's players
had been slightly hurt, and their places were filled
by two substitutes, which weakened the eleven still
more.</p>

<p>"Henshaw and Babcock are out of it!" cried
Phil, to Roger and Dave.</p>

<p>"That gives us a better chance to win," said the
senator's son.</p>

<p>"If it isn't too late," returned Sam Day; "12
to 0 is a pretty hard lead to overcome."</p>

<p>"We'll do our best," said Dave. "Let every
man go in for all he is worth!"</p>

<p>The play was fast and furious from the very
start, and inside of two minutes Roger's players
had the leather close to the Arrows' goal line.
But then Nick Jasniff with extreme roughness
hurled Sam Day to the ground. Jasniff was off-side
at the time and his movements were consequently
contrary to the rules.</p>

<p>"You may retire from the field," said the
referee, after he and the umpire had talked the
matter over.</p>

<p>Poor Sam was in bad shape when picked up and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

carried from the field, but fortunately he recovered
inside of an hour. In the meantime another player
was put in his place and another in the place of
Jasniff and the game went on.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE END OF THE GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"A touchdown</span></span> for the Morr team!"</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it!"</p>

<p>"Now make it a goal!"</p>

<p>The leather had been carried over the line after
hard work. Without delay it was placed in position
for the kick and went sailing directly between
the two posts.</p>

<p>"That's the talk!"</p>

<p>"Now go and make another!"</p>

<p>There were still eighteen minutes in which to
play. The goal made Roger, Dave, and the others
enthusiastic, and they "sailed in" as never before.
On the other hand, the loss of Babcock, Henshaw,
and Jasniff cast a gloom over Gus Plum's eleven
and the bully could do little to rally them.</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to fire Babcock and Henshaw,"
said one of the tackles. "They were our
best players."</p>

<p>"That's right," added the center rush.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say they can play better than
I and Nat?" demanded Gus Plum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"They can play just as well," grumbled the
tackle.</p>

<p>"Rot! Come on ahead and wax 'em!"</p>

<p>But the call to "wax" Roger's team was of small
avail. With Babcock and Henshaw gone the
Arrows could do little or nothing, and soon Dave
kicked a goal from the field. Then came another
touchdown, another goal from the field, and two
more touchdowns. Each of the touchdowns resulted
in goal kicks. The Arrows were in despair
and could do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>"Pile it on!" cried Roger, enthusiastically.
"Pile it on, boys!" And they did pile it on, until
the whistle blew and the game was over.</p>

<p>Final score&mdash;Plum's eleven 12, Roger Morr's
eleven 45!</p>

<p>It was a terrible defeat for the bully of Oak Hall
and he could scarcely wait for the game to come to
an end. He fairly ran for the gymnasium when
it was over and did his best to keep out of sight
for the rest of the day and all day Sunday, and Nat
Poole went with him.</p>

<p>The cheering for Roger and his eleven was
great, and all the players came in for their full
share of glory. Dave had done some remarkably
clever work, for which his friends shook his hand
and congratulated him.</p>

<p>"Well, you gave Gus Plum's crowd all that was
coming to them," said one of the students to Dave.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

"I don't think he'll ever organize another football
eleven in this academy."</p>

<p>What this student said was practically true.
During the following week the Arrows held
several stormy sessions and the upshot was that the
eleven disbanded. Nearly all the players were
angry because Gus Plum had put Henshaw and
Babcock out of the game, for to this they attributed
their defeat. It leaked out that Plum had wanted
the two players to play some rough trick on Roger's
eleven, and both Babcock and Henshaw had declined,
stating that it was against the rules and unsportsmanlike.
This had angered the bully, and
hence the quarrel and separation.</p>

<p>"I want to play fairly and squarely or not at
all," said Babcock, and Henshaw said practically
the same thing. Gus Plum denied the report, but
nobody believed him.</p>

<p>During the following week Dave was taking a
walk along the river bank when he heard loud talking
close at hand. Looking through the bushes he
saw Sam Day and Nick Jasniff.</p>

<p>"You had no business to jump on me as you did
at the game," Sam was saying. "It was outrageous."</p>

<p>"Oh, stop your yowling," grumbled Jasniff.
"It wasn't done on purpose."</p>

<p>"It was done on purpose, Nick Jasniff, and I
think you were a brute to do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam had scarcely uttered the latter words when
Nick Jasniff, who carried a heavy stick in his hand,
leaped forward and struck out. The stick landed
on Sam's head and he went down in a heap.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he groaned. "Don't hit me again!"</p>

<p>"Won't I, though!" cried Nick Jasniff, in a passion.
"I'd like to know what's to hinder me?"
And he raised the stick again.</p>

<p>"Stop, Jasniff!" came from Dave, and leaping
through the bushes he came up behind the student
and caught the stick in his hand. "What do you
mean by attacking Sam in this fashion?"</p>

<p>"Let go of that stick!" ejaculated Jasniff, and
tried to pull it away. Then a tussle ensued which
came to an end as Dave twisted the stick from
the other youth's grasp and flung it into the
river.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by throwing my cane
away?" cried Jasniff.</p>

<p>"I want you to leave Sam alone."</p>

<p>"I've a good mind to give you a drubbing."</p>

<p>"Better not try it, Jasniff," answered Dave, as
calmly as he could. He stood on guard against
any treachery.</p>

<p>"Think you're the king of the school, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am always ready to stand up for a
friend."</p>

<p>By this time Sam was staggering to his feet. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

rushed at Nick Jasniff and sent him backward into
the bushes.</p>

<p>"You will hit me with your stick!" he exclaimed.
"Thank you, Dave, for what you did, but I can
take my own part." And he stood over Jasniff
with clenched fists.</p>

<p>"Two to one, eh?" sneered Jasniff, as he got up
slowly. "That's fighting fair, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"It is fairer than hitting a fellow with a stick,"
retorted Sam. "But I can fight you alone, if you
want to fight."</p>

<p>"I'll not soil my hands on you further," grumbled
Nick Jasniff, and backing away, he walked off
towards the school at a rapid pace.</p>

<p>"The coward!" murmured Sam, as he and Dave
watched the departure.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Sam, I don't like that fellow at
all," said Dave. "I've said so before. He's a
bad egg if ever there was one."</p>

<p>"I believe you. Cadfield told me that there was
a report in the town Jasniff came from that he had
once set fire to a farmer's barn because the farmer
caught him stealing peaches, but the whole matter
was hushed up."</p>

<p>"He doesn't appear to be any too good to set fire
to a barn. We'll have to keep our eyes open for
him after this."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall. I don't want to be struck
down with a stick again," answered Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>With the brisk autumn winds blowing, kite-flying
was in favor with many of the students of Oak
Hall and numerous were the big and little kites
that were sent up. Some were curiously painted,
some were of the box variety, while others were in
the shape of eagles and other big birds. Most
of the kites were raised from a meadow near the
river, and every afternoon a crowd of students
would go down to watch the sport.</p>

<p>Roger made for himself an immense eagle kite,
while Phil tried his hand at a plain affair, shaped
like a diamond and eight feet high and five feet
across.</p>

<p>"That ought to be strong enough to pull a
wagon," was Dave's comment, as he surveyed
Phil's creation. "You'll have to get a pretty
strong cord to hold it, otherwise it may drag you
into the river&mdash;if the wind happens to be blowing
that way."</p>

<p>One afternoon a number of the boys brought out
their flat kites and started to see who could make
his fly the highest. Among the crowd was Nat
Poole, who had a gorgeous affair painted yellow
and red.</p>

<p>"Wait till you see this soar upward," he said,
boastfully. "I'll bet it will go up a hundred feet
higher than any other."</p>

<p>Half a dozen kites were already in the air and
soon more were raised. Then Poole ran his new

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

kite up. It arose a distance of a hundred feet and
then began to dart from side to side.</p>

<p>"You want more tail, Nat!" cried a friend.</p>

<p>"That kite isn't balanced right," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right, only it isn't high enough," answered
Nat Poole. He was not one to take advice,
and so he did his best to get the kite to ascend
without altering it.</p>

<p>Among those in the meadow at the time was Job
Haskers. He was going on a visit to some ladies
who lived not far from the Hall and was taking a
short cut instead of journeying around by the
regular road. He did not care for sports of any
kind and so paid small attention to what was taking
place. He was arrayed in his best, and on his
head rested a new high hat, the silk nap polished
to the best degree.</p>

<p>Dave was aiding Phil to manage his big kite and
so did not notice the assistant teacher until Job
Haskers passed close by.</p>

<p>"My! but he is dressed up!" Dave remarked to
his chum.</p>

<p>"Must be going to see his best lady friend," was
Phil's comment. "Oh, look at Nat Poole's kite!"
he added, suddenly.</p>

<p>Dave looked and saw the kite in question far up
in the sky and swooping wildly from side to side.
Then the kite made a downward plunge, skimming
over the meadow like a wild bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out, or somebody will get hit!" cried
Dave, and fell down as the kite passed within a
foot of his head. Then the kite went up again,
only to take another plunge.</p>

<p>As this was occurring, Job Haskers was starting
to leap over a small brook that flowed across the
meadow into the river. Another wild plunge, and
down came Poole's kite on the teacher's head,
smashing the silk hat flat and sending Job Haskers
face first into the stream of muddy water!</p>

<p>The score of boys who witnessed the mishap
could not help but laugh, and a roar went up. The
teacher floundered around wildly and it was several
seconds before he could pull himself from the
brook. His face and the front of his clothing
were covered with mud, and he was more angry
than words can describe.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;Who did that?" he spluttered,
after ejecting some of the dirty water from
his mouth. "I demand to know who did it!"
And he shook his fist at the students.</p>

<p>"The kite did it," answered one boy, who stood
behind some others.</p>

<p>"Whose kite was it?"</p>

<p>At this there was a silence, no one caring to tell
upon Nat Poole, who stood with the kite string
still in his hand and his mouth wide open in amazement
and terror.</p>

<p>"I say, whose kite was it?" bawled the irate

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>

teacher, and then, as he rubbed the water from his
eyes, he caught sight of the kite and the string.
"Ha! so it was yours, Master Poole!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn't mean to do it," stammered
Nat Poole. "The&mdash;the kite came down all of a
sudden."</p>

<p>"Infamous! Look at me! Look at my hat!"
Job Haskers caught up the battered tile. "This is
an outrage!"</p>

<p>"Really, I didn't mean to do it, Mr. Haskers,"
pleaded Poole. He was fairly shaking in his
shoes. "The&mdash;the kite got the best of me!"</p>

<p>"A likely story! You boys are forever trying
to play your tricks on me! I know you! You'll
pay for this silk hat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I'll do that," answered Nat, eagerly.</p>

<p>"And you'll pay for having this suit of clothes
cleaned."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you'll pay all other damages, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you'll go to your classroom and stay there
until supper time," went on Job Haskers, in high
anger. "Stay there every day this week, too. Do
you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not listen to a word, young man. Go,&mdash;go
at once! If I had my way I'd dismiss you from
the school!" roared the assistant teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And then and there he made Nat Poole take up
his kite and march off to the academy, there to stay
in after school every day for a full week. More
than this, he brought in a bill for fifteen dollars'
worth of damage, to the silk hat and the suit of
clothing, and this bill Aaron Poole had to pay, even
though the miserly money-lender did his best to
evade it.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">ALL ON ACCOUNT OF A KITE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"That</span></span>'s the time Poole caught it," remarked
Phil, after the excitement had come to an end.</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Dave. "I am glad it
was not your kite, Phil."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"In one way, it was Nat's own fault," said
Roger, who was near. "Half a dozen told him to
balance the kite better, but he wouldn't listen."</p>

<p>Down on the river some of the students had
attached their kites to boats and were having races.
But soon the wind changed and the kites veered
around to another point of the compass and the
races had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Phil's kite was well up and it was all he and
Dave could do to manage it. Roger and Ben grew
somewhat tired of the sport presently and brought
down their kite and wound up the string. Then
Phil and Dave began to lower the big kite.</p>

<p>"The wind is freshening," observed Dave.
"Gracious! how this big kite does tug!"</p>

<p>He could scarcely hold it as Phil wound up the
cord. Then came another blast of air and Dave

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>

fell backward with the broken string in his hand,
while the big kite went soaring away in the direction
of Oakdale.</p>

<p>"There goes the kite!"</p>

<p>"Stop it! stop it!" yelled Phil, forgetting himself
in his excitement.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Dave, dryly, as he arose from
the grass.</p>

<p>"I don't want to lose that fine kite," went on
Phil, soberly. "Why, it cost me over three dollars
to make it. It was part silk!"</p>

<p>"Let us go after it," said Dave. "I don't think
it will sail so very far."</p>

<p>Roger's kite was placed in the care of Buster
Beggs and Shadow Hamilton, and off went the
senator's son, Dave, and Phil after the runaway
kite. The course was almost straight for Oakdale
and presently they saw the silken affair settle in the
direction of Mike Marcy's orchard.</p>

<p>"It is going down at Marcy's!" cried Roger.</p>

<p>"I hope it doesn't get torn in the trees," returned
Phil, who was doubly proud of the kite because he
had made it alone and by his own plan.</p>

<p>"Maybe Marcy won't give it to us," said Dave.
"Remember, he doesn't like us students."</p>

<p>"Yes, and remember, too, that he keeps dogs,"
added Roger.</p>

<p>Mike Marcy was an Irish-American farmer who
had lived in that section for many years. He was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

what is termed a "close-fisted man," and one who
had but little to do with the outside world. He
was supposed to be rich, although he usually put on
an air of poverty whenever anybody called upon
him. His farm was of fair size, and contained a
good stone house, a barn, and several other out-buildings.
He had a big orchard, and to keep off
thieves kept half a dozen dogs, all of them more or
less savage creatures.</p>

<p>The three students approached the orchard from
the rear and after looking around located the silken
kite in the limbs of an apple tree. The tree was
bare of fruit, but close at hand were other trees
loaded with golden russets.</p>

<p>"Wonder if we can get that kite without being
seen," mused Phil, as he gazed longingly at his
property, dangling downward by its gorgeous tail
of fancy ribbons.</p>

<p>"I don't see anybody around," answered Dave.
"And I don't hear any of his dogs either."</p>

<p>"You want to go slow," cautioned the senator's
son. "He may be around, watching us on the sly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better go around to the road
and ask for the kite," said Dave.</p>

<p>"No, he won't give it to us," answered Phil.
"He is too mean&mdash;I know him. I'd rather try to
get it on the sly."</p>

<p>The wind was still blowing and it was growing
dark. They took another careful look around and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

then leaped the fence of the orchard. Soon they
were at the tree from which the kite dangled, and
Phil climbed up.</p>

<p>"Catch it!" he called, as he loosened the tail, but
just then the wind caught the kite and carried it to
the other side of the orchard.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" cried Dave, and made a run
after the object. The others followed, and
presently they had the kite in their possession. In
running through the orchard Dave caught his foot
on a tree root and fell headlong but did not hurt
himself.</p>

<p>With the kite in their possession the three
students left the orchard as quickly as they had
entered it. It was now so late that they were
afraid they could not get back to Oak Hall in time
for supper and so set off at a brisk pace. But suddenly
Dave came to a stop.</p>

<p>"I declare, my watch is gone!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Your watch!" asked his chums, in concert.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must have dropped it when I stumbled
in the orchard."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, that's too bad!" cried Roger.</p>

<p>"I'll have to go back for it," went on Dave.
"It's the new watch my uncle gave me."</p>

<p>"Shall we go back with you?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"No, there is no use of all three of us being late.
You can tell Mr. Dale I lost my watch and stopped
to hunt for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment Dave had turned back and
Phil and the senator's son continued on their way
to Oak Hall. Dave started on a run, and it did
not take him long to reach the orchard once more.
Down under the trees it was very dark and he had
to feel around for the watch. But he had dropped
it just where he thought, and soon had it in his
possession again.</p>

<p>"Now I had better hump myself and get back,"
he murmured, and started for the fence once more.
Scarcely had he gone four steps when a form
loomed up before him and he found himself in the
strong clutch of Mike Marcy.</p>

<p>"Caught ye, have I?" said the farmer, in a cold,
hard voice.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Marcy," replied Dave, as
coolly as he could.</p>

<p>"How do ye do, is it?" roared the farmer. "I'll
fix ye, ye villain!" And he started to shake Dave
with great violence. He was a strong man and
one given to sudden passion.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the youth, trying to squirm away.
"Stop! What are you doing this for? I have
done nothing wrong."</p>

<p>"Then stealin' apples ain't wrong, eh? And
stonin' my dogs ain't wrong, eh? And stealin' a
chicken, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am not stealing apples, and the only time I
stoned one of your dogs was when he ran after me

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

as I was passing on the road. I didn't propose to
be bitten."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me, ye young vagabond! I know
you boys&mdash;a pretty crowd ye be, all o' ye! I'll
have the law on ye!" And once again Mike
Marcy shook poor Dave.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mike?" came from out of the
gloom, and a woman appeared. She was the
farmer's wife and as hard-hearted as her husband.</p>

<p>"I've got one o' them schoolboys," answered
the man. "Caught him prowlin' around the
orchard."</p>

<p>"See here, I have done no wrong, I tell you, and
I want you to treat me decently," said Dave. "We
came over awhile ago for a kite, that sailed into
one of your trees. After we got the kite I discovered
that I had lost my watch and I came back
for it."</p>

<p>"A fine story indade," muttered Mike Marcy.
"But it's not me that is going to believe that same.
I've caught ye and I am going to make an example
of ye!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mike, don't let him go," put in Mrs.
Marcy.</p>

<p>"You haven't any right to detain me," said
Dave. "I have told you the exact truth."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, and until ye can prove the
tale ye'll stay here."</p>

<p>With this Mike Marcy took a firmer hold of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>

Dave's collar than ever and began to drag him
through the orchard towards the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Dave struggled, but the strong farmer was too
much for him and he was compelled to go along.
The farmer's wife came behind the pair, armed
with a mop she had picked up at the back door.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked the
youth, after a minute of silence.</p>

<p>"Ye'll soon see," answered the farmer.</p>

<p>They soon reached the barnyard attached to the
farm. Here, to one side, was a smokehouse, built
of stone, with a heavy door of wood and sheet-iron.
The small building was open and empty.</p>

<p>"I'll put ye in there for a while and see how ye
like it," said Mike Marcy, and shoved Dave towards
the smokehouse.</p>

<p>"See here, Mr. Marcy, you are not treating me
fairly. You have no right to make me a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Sure and I'll take the right. I have suffered
enough and I'm going to teach somebody a lesson,"
answered the farmer, grimly.</p>

<p>"When Dr. Clay hears of this he'll make trouble
for you."</p>

<p>"Will he? Not much, I'm after thinkin'. Ye
had no right to be trespassin' on my land. The
signs are up, and I take it ye can read."</p>

<p>"I simply came over to get something that belonged
to me."</p>

<p>"Well, ye'll stay here for a while, an' that is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

all there is to it," returned Mike Marcy, and without
further ceremony he thrust Dave into the
smokehouse. The youth began to struggle but
could not get away, and once inside, the door was
banged shut in his face. Then the bolt was
secured with a stout iron pin, and he found himself
a prisoner in pitch darkness.</p>

<p>"I'll be back sooner or later," cried Mike Marcy,
in a satisfied tone. "So make yourself comfortable,
me laddibuck!" And then he walked away,
followed by his wife, and Dave was left to himself.</p>

<p>It was a galling position to be in and Dave resented
it thoroughly. Yet what to do he did not
know. He could not see a thing and on all sides
of him were the thick stone walls of the building,
the only break being the iron-covered door, which
was practically as solid as the walls themselves.
Under his feet the ground was as hard as stone.
Everything was covered with a thick soot, so that
he scarcely dared to put out a hand for fear of becoming
like a negro.</p>

<p>"Here's a fine mess truly!" he murmured to himself,
after several minutes had passed.</p>

<p>He listened, but not a sound broke the stillness.
He wondered how it happened that Mike Marcy's
dogs were not around, not knowing that the farmer
had lost one through a peculiar sickness and had
taken the others away to a dog doctor for special
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>A quarter of an hour passed. The time was unusually
long to Dave, and now, at the risk of getting
black, he began to feel around the smokehouse,
looking for some means of escaping from his
prison. From over his head dangled an iron chain,
used for smoking purposes, and he climbed this,
reaching a crossbar above. From the crossbar he
could touch the roof, which proved to be of heavy
planking, well joined together.</p>

<p>"If I could only knock off one of those planks I
might get out," he reasoned, and began to feel of
one plank after another, trying to determine which
would offer the least resistance to his efforts.</p>

<p>Dave had just discovered a plank which seemed
to be a little looser than the others when a sound
outside broke upon his ears. Thinking that Mike
Marcy was coming back, he dropped to the flooring
of the smokehouse.</p>

<p>The sounds came closer and presently he heard
two persons come to a halt close to the smokehouse
door. By their voices they were evidently men,
but neither was the owner of the place.</p>

<p>Wondering what this new arrival meant Dave
remained quiet and listened intently. For several
seconds he could not make out what was being said.
Then he heard words which filled him with astonishment
and alarm.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
<span class="small">AT THE WIDOW FAIRCHILD'S HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Are</span></span> you dead certain the money is in the
house?" were the first words that Dave heard distinctly.
They came in rather a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw Mrs. Fairchild draw the money
from the bank. She put it in a black bag and
started straight for her home." The reply came
in a voice that was also hoarse, almost guttural.</p>

<p>"It would certainly be a dandy haul."</p>

<p>"Just what I've said all along."</p>

<p>"But the risk. If that hired man sleeps in the
house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think he does. The widow don't like
men folks around. I heard that from one of
the neighbors, the day I went to price some
chickens."</p>

<p>"Well, we might go over to her place and take a
look around," came after a pause, and then followed
some conversation that Dave could not
catch. A few minutes later the two men walked
away, and the youth heard no more of them.</p>

<p>Dave was amazed and with good reason. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
understood the situation at all the two men intended
to rob the house of a widow who lived
about half a mile up the road. They had seen her
draw some money from a bank somewhere and intended
to take the amount from her.</p>

<p>"They must be the very chaps who robbed Mr.
Lapham and also the place in Oakdale," he
thought. "I must get out and do what I can to
outwit them!"</p>

<p>In feverish haste he climbed the chain again and
pushed on the plank of the roof. By hard work he
managed to loosen one end, but the other end
seemed to be tight and refused to budge.</p>

<p>"If I only had something to pry it off with," he
mused, but could find nothing. Then, almost in
desperation, he dropped to the ground again and
began to pound on the door, at the same time shouting
at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>For a good five minutes this brought forth no
response, but presently Mike Marcy came forth
from the farmhouse, lantern in hand, and stalked
over to his barn. When he came out he carried a
long rawhide whip in his hand.</p>

<p>"Say, boy, quit that noise, or I'll tan ye well!"
he cried, wrathfully, as he came up to the smokehouse
and set the lantern on the ground.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marcy, is that you?" queried Dave,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis, and I want ye to stop that racket."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me out at once&mdash;it is very important," went
on Dave.</p>

<p>"Important, is it?" sneered the Irish-American
farmer. "'Tis more important ye stop that noise,
so it is!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Marcy, listen to me," said Dave. "I have
something very important to tell you. If you
won't listen there will be big trouble. You must
let me out, and both of us must catch two burglars."</p>

<p>"Sure, and what is the lad talkin' about?" exclaimed
the farmer.</p>

<p>"I am telling you the truth. Let me out instantly."</p>

<p>"'Tis a trick, I'm after thinkin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I give you my word of honor it is not.
Let me out and I will explain. Please hurry
up."</p>

<p>Dave's earnestness at last impressed the farmer
to the extent that he opened the door cautiously for
the space of a foot. As the youth came forth the
man caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Now don't try to run, or 'twill be the worse for
ye!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Marcy, listen!" cried Dave. "Only a
short while ago two men were here. They stopped
close to the smokehouse to talk. They spoke of
the Widow Fairchild having money in her house
which she had just gotten from the bank. They

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

talked of robbing her, and they went off to do the
job."</p>

<p>The farmer listened and his jaw dropped
slightly.</p>

<p>"Is it a fairy story ye are after tellin'?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it is the absolute truth. I think they
were the same chaps who robbed Mr. Lapham and
robbed that house in Oakdale. They seem to be
doing their best to loot this whole neighborhood."</p>

<p>"They were here?" faltered Mike Marcy. At
last he began to believe Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, not over quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Did they speak of robbing my place?" went
on the Irish-American farmer suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I am sure they started directly for Mrs.
Fairchild's place."</p>

<p>"And ye want me to go with ye and catch
them?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it our duty to catch them if we can?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But can we do it alone?"</p>

<p>"We can call up somebody else on the way."</p>

<p>"So we can. Well, I'll go&mdash;but first I'll take a
look around my own place," added Mike Marcy.</p>

<p>He took his lantern and walked around the house
and then told his wife of Dave's discovery. Mrs.
Marcy began to tremble as she listened, and she
shook her head when her husband said he proposed
to go after the robbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not meself is going to stay here all alone,
wid robbers floatin' around in the dark," said Mrs.
Marcy. "Let the boy call up the constable, or
somebody else."</p>

<p>"It will take too long," said Dave, impatiently.
"Even now it may be too late."</p>

<p>"Ye'll be safe enough with the doors and windows
locked," said Mike Marcy. "Ye can use
the shotgun if they come back. I'll take the
pistol."</p>

<p>He was a man used to having his own way, and
soon he set off with his pistol in his pocket and a
good-sized club in his hand. Dave armed himself
with another club, and set a good stiff pace, once
they were on the road.</p>

<p>"We can stop at Brown's house and call him
up," said Mike Marcy. He referred to Farmer
Brown, who occupied a house directly on the road
they were traveling. Reaching the place they
knocked loudly on the door and presently the
owner stuck his head out of an upper window.</p>

<p>"What's wanted?"</p>

<p>"Come down here," shouted Mike Marcy.
"We want ye to help capture two robbers."</p>

<p>"Two robbers?" said Farmer Brown.</p>

<p>"Mercy sakes alive!" burst out the farmer's
wife. "Are robbers around? We'll all be murdered
in our beds!"</p>

<p>"They ain't here&mdash;they be over to the Widow

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

Fairchild's," answered Mike Marcy. "Come on.
Is Bill around?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am," said the farmer's son, from
another window. "I'll be down in a minit, with
my gun."</p>

<p>There was a short argument after this, but in the
end Farmer Brown and his son Bill, a tall, wiry
youth of nineteen, agreed to accompany Mike
Marcy and Dave. Mrs. Fairchild's home was less
than a quarter of a mile away, and to cut off a bend
of the highway they took to an open field which
came to an end at the edge of the widow's
orchard.</p>

<p>"There is the house," whispered Mike Marcy,
at last. "Better go slow now."</p>

<p>"Yes, we don't want them to get away," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>"Let us spread out around the house," advised
Farmer Brown. "The first one to spot the rascals
can give the alarm."</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and while Dave went to the
rear of the dwelling the others passed to the front
and sides. The place was pitch dark on the inside
and lit up only by the light of the stars from without.</p>

<p>Dave's heart was beating rather rapidly, for
there was no telling when he would find himself
face to face with the two robbers, and he realized
that they must be desperate characters. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>

clutched the club tightly, resolved to do his best,
should it come to a hand-to-hand encounter.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed and slowly the four outside
walked completely around the building. Only
one window was open, that to the dining room.</p>

<p>"See anybody?" whispered Mike Marcy, coming
up to Dave.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Sure ye didn't make any mistake?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see a soul. Maybe they haven't come
up yet."</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"We can wait a while and see," suggested Bill
Brown. "If we wake the widder we may scare
'em off."</p>

<p>They waited after that for another spell, but nobody
appeared, nor did they hear any sound out of
the ordinary. Then it was resolved to arouse
Mrs. Fairchild and wait in the house for the coming
of the robbers.</p>

<p>"That is, if they are coming," said Farmer
Brown. "Maybe the boy made a mistake."</p>

<p>"I am certain I made no mistake," answered
Dave, positively. "But they may have changed
their plans."</p>

<p>"Humph!" muttered Mike Marcy. "If it's a
trick&mdash;But we'll talk that over later."</p>

<p>The door had an old-fashioned knocker, and this
Farmer Brown used lightly at first and then with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

vigor. To the surprise of all in the party nobody
answered the summons.</p>

<p>"The widder must be away!" cried Farmer
Brown. "Funny,&mdash;she was home at sundown.
Where would she go after dark?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's been murdered," suggested Bill.</p>

<p>"Murdered!" exclaimed the others, and Dave's
blood seemed to run cold.</p>

<p>"A regular robber wouldn't stop at murder, if
he was caught in the act," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Maybe we ought to break in the door."</p>

<p>"Or git in through the window," suggested
Mike Marcy.</p>

<p>While they were deliberating they heard the
sounds of carriage wheels on the road. The turnout
was coming along at smart speed and all ran
towards the road to see who was driving. To
their surprise they saw the Widow Fairchild alight,
followed by a farmer named Burr and a hired man
called Sandy.</p>

<p>"How do ye do, widder!" called out Farmer
Brown. "Been away long?"</p>

<p>"Why, what does this mean?" stammered Mrs.
Fairchild, who was a woman of forty and weighed
at least two hundred pounds. She often went out
to do nursing throughout the Oakdale district.</p>

<p>"We came here lookin' fer robbers," explained
Mike Marcy. "We thought they was comin' to
visit you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"By gum!" came from the farmer named Burr.
"Reckon you are right, Mrs. Fairchild."</p>

<p>"Right? How?" asked Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," answered the widow. "About
an hour ago somebody knocked on the door. I
opened the window upstairs and asked what was
wanted. A man was there muffled up in an overcoat.
Says he, 'Is that you, Mrs. Fairchild?'
'Yes,' says I. 'Well,' says he, 'you're wanted over
to Mrs. Burr's house right away. The baby is dying.
I've got to go for a doctor,' says he, and runs
away. I didn't hardly know what to do, but I
hurried into my clothes and locked up and almost
run to Mr. Burr's place. When I got there they
was all to bed and the baby as healthy as ever.
Then I got suspicious, for I've got four hundred
dollars in the house that I got out of the bank at
Rayfield to pay off on that new house I'm building
in Oakdale. Mr. Burr hitched up at once and
brought me over. So you know about the fellow,
do you?"</p>

<p>"I know two men started for this place to rob
your house," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Better go in and see if the money is safe," suggested
Farmer Brown. "Did you leave that window
open?" he added.</p>

<p>"Window open? No indeed!" shrieked Mrs.
Fairchild, and without further ceremony she
brought forth her key and opened the front door.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

Then she lit the lamp and began to make a search
of the premises.</p>

<p>"They have been in here!" she wailed. "See
how everything is upset!" She ran to a china
closet. "Oh, dear, look at the dishes! Some of
'em broken! Oh!" She gave a wild scream.
"The money is gone! They have robbed me of
the four hundred dollars!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
<span class="small">AT WORK IN THE DARK</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Dave</span></span> had more than half expected the declaration
the Widow Fairchild made, so when it came
he was not surprised. The others, however,
stared in bewilderment and dismay.</p>

<p>"All gone?" queried Mike Marcy.</p>

<p>"Every dollar!" groaned the widow. "Oh, the
rascals, the heartless villains! To rob a poor
widow in this fashion! And I worked so hard to
save that money! Oh, where are they? I must
catch them and get my money back!" And she
stalked around the room wringing her hands in her
despair.</p>

<p>"What a pity that we got here too late," said
Dave. "I wish you had hurried more," he continued
to the Irish-American farmer. "I told you
not to waste time."</p>

<p>"Don't ye blame me for this!" replied Mike
Marcy, half in alarm and half in wrath. "I hurried
all I could."</p>

<p>"Let us make a search for the rascals," said Joel
Burr. "They may not be very far off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"It won't do any good," announced Farmer
Brown. "We've been around here too long a-looking
for 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're a long way off by this time," said
his son Bill. "With four hundred dollars in their
pockets they won't let no grass grow under their
feet."</p>

<p>"This is the third robbery inside of six weeks,"
was Joel Burr's comment. "Must say they be
getting mighty free-handed."</p>

<p>In spite of what had been said, all went outside
and took a look around the grounds and up and
down the highway. But it was useless; not the
least trace of the burglars could be found anywhere
about.</p>

<p>While the others were outside, the widow inspected
her house more thoroughly. She said a
dozen silver spoons were missing and likewise an
old gold watch and some old-fashioned gold and
pearl jewelry. She placed her total loss at nearly
five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Dave had to tell his story in detail, to which all
of the others but Mike Marcy listened with interest.
The widow blamed the Irish-American
farmer for not having come to the house sooner,
declaring that had he done so the robbers would
have been caught red-handed; and quite a war of
words followed.</p>

<p>"What am I to do, now my money is gone?" she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

wailed. "I cannot pay that carpenter's bill and it
must be paid by the end of this month."</p>

<p>"You'll have to notify the constable, or the
sheriff," answered Joel Burr.</p>

<p>"What good will that do? They haven't done
anything for Lapham, nor for Jerry Logan who
was robbed in Oakdale."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what you can do, widder."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fairchild declared, when she had settled
down a little, that the man who had spoken to her
about the sick baby had had a hoarse voice, and all
were satisfied that that individual was one of those
Dave had heard talk near the smokehouse. But
she had not seen his face, so she could not give any
description of him excepting to say that he was
rather tall.</p>

<p>It was now nearly eleven o'clock, and as Dave
had had no supper he was hungry. His tramping
around had made him tired, and he said if he was
not wanted any more he would go home.</p>

<p>"Go as far as I am concerned," said Mike
Marcy. "But don't lay the blame of this robbery
on me. Remember, ye had no right to be trespassin'
on my property."</p>

<p>"I simply told the truth," said Dave; and a little
later he withdrew and hurried forth into the night
in the direction of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>It was a lonely road and a less courageous boy
might have been frightened. It was cold and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>

quiet and he walked a full mile without meeting a
soul. Then, as he was passing Mike Marcy's orchard,
two figures sprang out in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Dave!"</p>

<p>"Hello, so it is you, Phil, and Roger! What
brought you out again?"</p>

<p>"We came to find you. We were afraid you
had gotten into trouble with Mike Marcy," answered
Phil.</p>

<p>"Where in the world have you been?" asked the
senator's son. "We reported that you had lost
your watch, but didn't expect you'd stay away so
long."</p>

<p>"Well, I've had troubles enough," answered
Dave, with a faint smile, and as the three hurried
for the academy he told his tale from beginning to
end.</p>

<p>"Well, if this doesn't beat the Greeks!" exclaimed
Phil. "Say, these robberies are getting
serious."</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell Dr. Clay?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I haven't done anything wrong,
so why shouldn't I tell him?"</p>

<p>"I guess you are right. But I shouldn't disturb
him to-night. It will be time enough to go to him
in the morning."</p>

<p>Phil and Roger had gotten out of the Hall by a
back way, leaving the door unlocked behind them.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

The three boys, as a consequence, entered easily,
and then Dave took the chance of being discovered
by going down to the kitchen for something to eat.
In the pantry he found a pumpkin pie, some cold
beans, and some milk, and on these made a hearty
repast. Then he went to bed and slept soundly
until the bell awoke him at seven o'clock.</p>

<p>He felt that he should be reprimanded and he
was not mistaken. Job Haskers strode up to him
as soon as he went below.</p>

<p>"Master Porter, where were you last evening?"
he demanded, in harsh tones.</p>

<p>"I lost my watch, Mr. Haskers, and went to
look for it. Then something very unusual happened,
which I am going to report to Dr. Clay."</p>

<p>"Something unusual, eh?" said the assistant
teacher, curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I prefer to report to Dr. Clay."</p>

<p>"Hum! Very well&mdash;I will talk to the doctor
myself later. We cannot permit pupils of this
institution to come and go at will." And with an
air of great importance Job Haskers passed on.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over Dave went to
Dr. Clay's private study. The worthy owner
of Oak Hall was at his desk, looking over some
letters which had just come in. He gazed at Dave
in mild curiosity.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clay, may I speak to you for a few
minutes?" asked the youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, Porter. Come in and sit down."</p>

<p>Dave entered and closed the door after him, for
he had caught sight of Job Haskers close at hand,
curious to learn what he might have to say for himself.
Sitting down he told his rather remarkable
story, to which the master of the Hall listened with
close attention.</p>

<p>"These robbers are certainly getting bold," said
Dr. Clay. "It is a pity you could not get out
of that smokehouse sooner."</p>

<p>"That is just what I told the others."</p>

<p>"You are certain you went over to Marcy's only
for the kite and later for the watch?" and the doctor
looked Dave squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"That's it, sir. I did not touch his apples or
anything else, and neither did Phil nor Roger."</p>

<p>"Then he certainly had no right to lock you up.
Do you wish to make a complaint against him?"</p>

<p>"No, not that. Only I wanted to explain why I
didn't get back to school last evening."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Mr. Haskers approached me about it and acted
as if he wanted to punish me."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, you can tell him that I have taken
the matter in hand and that you have been excused.
I have but one fault to find, and that is&mdash;&mdash;"
The doctor paused and smiled.</p>

<p>"That we didn't catch the robbers," finished
Dave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly. The authorities must get after the
rascals. Until they are caught nobody in this district
will be safe."</p>

<p>After a few words more Dave left the office and
went to his classroom. As he did this Job Haskers
entered the doctor's office. He must have
asked the master of Oak Hall about Dave, for
after he came away he said nothing more to the
youth concerning his absence.</p>

<p>The next few days went quietly by. From Lemond
the boys learned that Mrs. Fairchild had appealed
to the authorities and two detectives were at
work searching for the robbers, but so far nothing
had been learned about the rascals.</p>

<p>"They'll keep quiet for a while," said Ben, and
such proved to be the case.</p>

<p>One afternoon a letter reached Oak Hall addressed
to Roger Morr, Captain Oak Hall Football
Club. It proved to be the expected challenge
from Rockville Military Academy. The eleven
of that institution challenged the Oak Hall team
to play a game of football two weeks from that
date, on some grounds to be mutually decided upon.
Pinned to the challenge was a note stating a certain
rich gentleman named Richard Mongrace had
offered a fine gold cup to the winning team, providing
the match was played on the new grounds laid
out in his private park, located at Hilltop, six miles
from the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is the challenge at last," said Roger, and
he read it aloud. "I suppose there is nothing to
do but accept."</p>

<p>"Yes, we've got to give them the chance to even
up," said Phil.</p>

<p>"They haven't forgotten that we beat them last
season by a score of 11 to 8," said another of the
eleven.</p>

<p>"I've heard something about their team this
year," said Ben. "They have dropped three old
players and have three A No. 1 fellows in their
places. Two weeks ago, as you know, they beat
the Hamilton eleven, 17 to 5, and day before
yesterday they played White College eleven and
won out by a score of 12 to 5."</p>

<p>"Then they must be a heap stronger than they
were last year," said Buster Beggs. "For last year
White College beat them badly."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Hamilton beat them too," added
Dave. "I shouldn't wonder but that they've got a
crackajack team this year."</p>

<p>"Are we going to back out?" demanded the
senator's son.</p>

<p>"No!" came back in a chorus.</p>

<p>"Oak Hall never backs out!" cried Ben.</p>

<p>"Well, where are we to play? I suppose they
would like to play at the Mongrace field," said
Roger.</p>

<p>"It's a dandy spot&mdash;I was up there on my wheel

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

last Saturday," said Shadow Hamilton. "They've
got a nice stand there, too."</p>

<p>"And our field is all lumpy," said Phil. "The
doctor is going to have it leveled off next spring."</p>

<p>"Then let us go in for that gold cup!" cried Sam
Day. And several others echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>A regular meeting of the football club was called
that night, and it was decided, after consulting
Dr. Clay, to accept the Rockville challenge to
play on the Mongrace grounds. A letter was accordingly
written and forwarded the next Monday.</p>

<p>"Now we have got to brace up and practise,"
said the captain of the eleven.</p>

<p>"I wish you could get rid of two of our poorest
players and take on Babcock and Henshaw," remarked
Dave. "Those two would help us wonderfully."</p>

<p>"They both want to come in," answered the
senator's son. "But I don't see how I can drop
any of our present members after the way they
have worked."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that wouldn't be fair."</p>

<p>"I've already taken them on as substitutes.
Maybe they'll get in the game after all," went on
Roger.</p>

<p>Practice began in earnest during that week and
all did their best to follow the coaching they got
from the first assistant teacher, Andrew Dale, who
had been both a college player and a coach. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

play was a trifle mixed at times, but the boys
worked with a will and that counted for a good
deal. But then came a letter calling one of the
players home, to attend the funeral of an uncle.</p>

<p>"I've got to leave the eleven," said Luke Watson.
"You'll have to get somebody to take my
place."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to see you go," said Roger, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Take Babcock," went on Luke. "You couldn't
do better."</p>

<p>"I will," answered the senator's son.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<br /><br />
<span class="small">IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Paul Babcock</span></span> was more than glad to get on
the eleven actively, and that afternoon he showed
it in his practice. The work was snappy from
start to finish and gave Mr. Dale great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That is something like," declared the first assistant
teacher. "Keep it up and you will surely
win."</p>

<p>After the practice was over Babcock left the field
in company with Dave. As the two strolled across
the campus they passed Gus Plum, who scowled
deeply at his former player.</p>

<p>"Plum doesn't like it that you've come over to
us," observed Dave. "He looked like a regular
thundercloud."</p>

<p>"He has nobody to blame but himself," answered
Paul Babcock. "Even if his team were
still in existence I'd never play with him again. I
want to act on the square, and that is more than he
wants to do."</p>

<p>"I've heard he wanted you to use foul play."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he was at both Henshaw and me to do
some dirty work. But we declined, and I told him
I had a good mind to punch his nose for suggesting
it. That made him boiling mad."</p>

<p>In due course of time came a letter from Mr.
Richard Mongrace, stating he was glad to learn
the match was to come off on his new grounds, and
that he would do all in his power to make the two
elevens and their friends comfortable. The
golden cup he proposed to put up cost exactly one
hundred dollars and was to belong to the school
winning it twice in two or three games, one game a
year to be played for it.</p>

<p>Dr. Clay knew Mr. Mongrace well and one day
drove over to see the new grounds. He came back
in an enthusiastic mood.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mongrace is certainly a fine man," said
the master of Oak Hall. "He has with him a sick
brother who cannot leave the estate. This brother
used to be a famous football player on the Princeton
team. For his benefit Mr. Mongrace has laid
out the field, and he is going to have some of the
best amateur teams in the country play there."</p>

<p>"That will cost some money," said Roger.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is rich and can easily afford it.
He has erected a fine grand stand and will also put
up a big tent, where refreshments will be served to
the visitors from both academies."</p>

<p>After that the doctor spoke about the coming

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

event before the whole school. He said he trusted
that they would all act like young gentlemen while
guests of Mr. Mongrace and thus do their institution
credit.</p>

<p>The only persons at Oak Hall who did not look
forward to the match with favor were Plum,
Poole, and Jasniff. At first they thought to remain
at home during the contest, but afterwards
changed their minds, the reason being a plan which
Nick Jasniff proposed.</p>

<p>Jasniff was thoroughly unscrupulous, and a year
before had been dismissed from another boarding
academy because of his dishonorable actions. He
was a lad who was willing to do almost anything to
accomplish his end.</p>

<p>Jasniff's plan was nothing more or less than to
play a trick on some members of Roger's eleven, so
that they could not take part in the game. This
would weaken the Oak Hall club to such an extent
that they would be likely to lose.</p>

<p>"Can we do it?" asked Poole.</p>

<p>"Certainly we can," answered Nick Jasniff.
"Why, such things have been done hundreds of
times."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you propose?" asked Gus
Plum.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you to-morrow. I've got to think it
over."</p>

<p>"I wish I was dead sure Oak Hall would lose,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

whispered the bully of the school. "We might
make some money by the operation."</p>

<p>"So we could!" cried Nat Poole. "All the
Rockville boys are betting they will win."</p>

<p>"And we could bet the same way," said Jasniff,
with a leer. "Only we'll have to put up our money
through some outsider."</p>

<p>"I can fix that," said Gus Plum. "I know a
fellow in Oakdale who will do it for us."</p>

<p>The day set for the great football match dawned
bright and clear. As soon as they could get away
from their school duties Roger's eleven went out
for a short practice and Henshaw and the other
substitutes with them. Henshaw was sorry he was
not on the regular team, but said little about it.</p>

<p>While the practice was going on, Plum, Poole,
and Jasniff watched all the players closely, trying
to gain the knowledge of some tricks and signals,
which they hoped later to divulge to the Rockville
eleven.</p>

<p>The practice at an end, Babcock announced that
he wanted to go to a place called Leeton on an
errand. Leeton was a small railroad crossing two
miles from the school, where Babcock had a
relative living.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go with me?" he asked
Dave. "We can go over on our bicycles and be
back inside of an hour."</p>

<p>Dave was willing, thinking the short spin on a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

wheel would do him good. They soon set off, and
before long were well on the road.</p>

<p>"There's our chance!" cried Nick Jasniff, as he
and his cronies watched the departure. "Just
what I wanted!"</p>

<p>"Shall we go after them?" asked Plum.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>The bully and the others had bicycles&mdash;indeed
nearly every youth at Oak Hall had one, for the
craze was at its height. The three set off without
delay, following the same road Dave and Babcock
had taken.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the fact that they were being followed,
Dave and his companion spun along.
There was a winding road, across a brook, then up
a hill, and over another small hill to the railroad
crossing. At several places pedaling was rather
difficult, but they did not mind it, being fresh and
with good wind.</p>

<p>Arriving at the railroad crossing, Babcock
stopped at the house for which he was bound and
executed his errand. Then the two lads got a
drink of water at the well and started on the return.</p>

<p>"I'll race you back!" cried Babcock.</p>

<p>"Better not race to-day," cautioned Dave. "We
want to save our strength for the game."</p>

<p>"All right, Dave, just as you say. But a little
race wouldn't hurt me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from Leeton the road made a sharp
turn, coming up close to the railroad tracks. Here
there was a steep down grade for three hundred
feet. As the boys neared the turn they began to
coast, thinking the way perfectly clear.</p>

<p>They were almost to the bottom of the hill when
something happened that filled them with alarm.
Close to the side of the roadway stood a tall, slim
tree. As they came up the tree fell directly in their
path.</p>

<p>"Look out!" yelled Dave, who was in advance,
and then his bicycle struck the tree and he was
pitched headlong over the handle-bars. Babcock
also took a tumble, and both lads came down violently
at the side of the road, where there was a
gully filled with rocks and hard dirt. Both slid
along, turned over, and then lay still.</p>

<p>A full minute passed and neither Dave nor Babcock
offered to get up. Then from out of the
bushes near by Plum, Poole, and Jasniff emerged.</p>

<p>"We caught 'em right enough," muttered Jasniff.
"The tree came down just in time."</p>

<p>"Ar&mdash;are they hu&mdash;hurt much!" faltered Nat
Poole. His face was as white as death itself.</p>

<p>"They are certainly knocked out," answered
Nick Jasniff, coolly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope they ain't dead!" gasped Poole, his
knees beginning to shake.</p>

<p>"They are not dead," announced Gus Plum, who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

was bending over the fallen youths. "They are
stunned, that's all." And he breathed a short
sigh of relief, for he had been fearful of serious
results.</p>

<p>"We had better get away, before they come to
their senses and recognize us," went on Poole, who
was the most timid-hearted of the unworthy
trio.</p>

<p>While they were deliberating they heard the
whistle of a locomotive on the railroad and soon a
long train of empty freight cars came into view.
Then, when about half the train had gone by, the
cars came to a sudden halt, brought to a stop because
of a danger signal at the crossing.</p>

<p>"What's the freight train stopping for?" asked
Plum.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," answered Nick Jasniff. "But
I say," he added suddenly. "The very thing!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Let us put 'em both in one of the empty cars!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother!" answered Nat Poole, who,
had he had his choice, would have wheeled away
without delay.</p>

<p>"They are only stunned&mdash;they'll soon come
around," went on Jasniff. "If we leave them here
they may get in the game anyway. We may as
well send them off to parts unknown!"</p>

<p>This plan appealed strongly to Gus Plum, and
both he and Jasniff walked to the train and looked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

up and down the long line of empty cars. Not a
soul was in sight.</p>

<p>"The coast is clear," said Jasniff. "Come on,
we can do it in a jiffy, and nobody will be the
wiser."</p>

<p>They went over to Babcock, raised him up, and
carried him to the nearest of the cars. The sliding
door was wide open, and they pushed the unconscious
form half across the car floor. Then
they ran back and picked up Dave. At that moment
came the whistle of the locomotive.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, they are going to start!" said Jasniff,
and they lost no time in pushing Dave into the car.
Then Jasniff rolled the door shut.</p>

<p>"Might as well lock 'em in," he suggested, but
before he could accomplish his purpose the train
gave a jerk and went on its way. All three of
the students stared at it and watched it out of
sight.</p>

<p>"They are gone, that's sure," murmured Gus
Plum. His heart was beating violently.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they won't come back in a hurry,"
chuckled Nick Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Maybe they will be carried clear to New
York," said Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"If they are, so much the better."</p>

<p>"You are sure they weren't seriously hurt?"</p>

<p>"I guess not."</p>

<p>"If they are, and we are found out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is going to tell on us?" demanded Nick
Jasniff. "Don't you dare to open your trap, Nat."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shan't say a word."</p>

<p>"Nobody saw us," said Gus Plum. "So, if we
keep quiet, nobody will ever know we had anything
to do with it."</p>

<p>"What about the wheels?"</p>

<p>"Leave them right where they are. Somebody
will pick them up sooner or later. Both are
marked Oak Hall and have the initials on them."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we to do next?" asked Gus
Plum, after an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"Get out of here and wheel over to Oakdale,"
answered Nick Jasniff, who had become the leader
of the unworthies. "We can put our money in the
hands of Lancaster and he can put it up on Rockville
for us. We are now sure to win."</p>

<p>"Morr will put Henshaw in Babcock's place,"
said Poole, as they rode away.</p>

<p>"Will he? Not after Henshaw has had his dinner,"
and Nick Jasniff winked knowingly.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to dose him?" asked Plum.</p>

<p>"I guess I will. I sit close to him and I can
drop a little powder in his food which will make
him feel weak and dizzy all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Have you got the powder?"</p>

<p>"I can get it from Lancaster. He told me about
it several days ago."</p>

<p>"It isn't poison, is it?" asked Nat Poole. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

was beginning to grow afraid of Nick Jasniff's bold
ways.</p>

<p>"No, it won't hurt him a bit, only make him
weak and light-headed for a few hours."</p>

<p>"Then give it to him by all means," urged Gus
Plum. "With Porter, Babcock, and Henshaw out
of the game Rockville is bound to beat, and if we
make the right kind of bets we ought to win a pot
of money!"</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">CARRIED OFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">When</span></span> Dave came to his senses he found himself
rolling around the floor of the freight car.
The door was three-quarters shut and the train was
winding its way around several uneven curves.</p>

<p>He put his hand to his forehead. There was a
big lump near his left eye and his left hand was
bleeding from several scratches. The car was full
of dust and he began to cough.</p>

<p>"What a fearful tumble!" he muttered to himself,
and then sat up and stared around him.
"Where in the world am I?"</p>

<p>He had expected to find himself beside the highway;
instead he was boxed in and moving along at
a speed of twenty or more miles an hour. He
glanced through the open doorway and saw the
trees and rocks flashing by. It took him all of a
minute to collect his scattered senses, and then he
gazed around the dust-laden car. Only a few feet
away lay the form of Babcock. The youth was
breathing heavily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Paul!" he called out. "Paul! What does
this mean? Did you bring me here?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and on his hands and
knees he bent over his friend. Then he gave
Babcock a shake, and the hurt one opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"The tree&mdash;look out for the tree!" he murmured
and struggled to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"Paul, did you bring me here?" went on Dave.</p>

<p>"Me? Here? What do you mean? Where
am I?" stammered Babcock, and then he, too,
stared out of the doorway of the freight car.
"Well, I never!"</p>

<p>It was not until several minutes later that the
pair comprehended the truth of the fact that they
were in a freight car that was moving along at a
good rate of speed and that they had been put in
the car by some party or parties unknown.</p>

<p>"This certainly beats the Dutch!" cried Dave.
"Are you hurt much?"</p>

<p>"I am pretty well shaken up, and my shoulder is
a little lame, Dave. How about you?"</p>

<p>"I've got this lump and those scratches, that's
all."</p>

<p>"You went into that tree and so did I. Do you
remember what happened after that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. Somebody must have put us in
here. Who was it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't ask me, and don't ask me where we are
going either, for I haven't the least idea."</p>

<p>The two students talked the matter over for
fully five minutes, but could reach no conclusion.
At first they fancied that they might have been
robbed, but nothing was missing but their wheels.</p>

<p>"This is a mystery we must solve later," said
Dave. "The present question is, How are we to
get off this train and get back to the Hall?"</p>

<p>A moment later the freight train passed through
a small lumber town. They heard a mill whistle
blowing. Dave pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"Why, Paul, it is twelve o'clock!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Babcock consulted his own time-piece.
"You are right! And we were going to be
back to the Hall by dinner time!"</p>

<p>"Don't forget that to-day is the day for the
great football match."</p>

<p>"Creation! Do you know it slipped my mind
for the moment! Why, Dave, we must get back!"</p>

<p>"I agree with you."</p>

<p>"Let us get off the train at once."</p>

<p>"What, with the cars running at twenty-five or
thirty miles an hour! No, thank you! We've
had one bad tumble, I don't want a second."</p>

<p>Babcock looked out of the doorway. The lumber
town had been left behind and they were running
through a dense woods. How far they were
from Leeton and Oak Hall they could not tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we could signal the engineer, I'd soon
stop the train," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Can't we crawl to the top of the car?"</p>

<p>"We might if we were regular train hands, but
as greenies we had better not risk it."</p>

<p>Another mile was passed, and the train began to
go around another curve. Then came a steep upgrade
and the speed of the cars was slackened.</p>

<p>"We're slowing up!" cried Babcock. "Maybe
we can jump for it now."</p>

<p>The locomotive was puffing laboriously, and
presently the train seemed to do little but crawl
along. The boys looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Shall we go?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right, here goes!"</p>

<p>Dave swung himself down and made a jump in
safety. Fifty feet further on Paul Babcock did
the same. Then the long freight train rolled by,
a brakeman on the caboose gazing at them curiously
as it passed.</p>

<p>"Well, where are we?" asked Babcock, gazing
around with interest.</p>

<p>"On the line of the D. S. &amp; B. railroad," answered
Dave, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"I know that well enough, but where on the
line?"</p>

<p>"Some miles from Leeton. The question is,
Shall we walk back on the track?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know of anything else to do. We can
find out where we are when we reach that lumber
town where we heard the whistle blowing."</p>

<p>They walked along the track for all of a mile
and a half and then came in sight of the lumber
town, which consisted of nothing but the mill, one
general store, and a dozen frame houses. It was
now nearly one o'clock and the men of the mill
were preparing to resume their day's labor.</p>

<p>"What town is this?" asked Dave, of a boy they
met.</p>

<p>"This town is Mill Run," answered the youth.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Leeton?"</p>

<p>"About twelve miles."</p>

<p>"Twelve miles!" ejaculated Babcock.</p>

<p>"Yes, and maybe more."</p>

<p>"Do you know when we can get back to Leeton?"</p>

<p>"Not till seven-thirty to-night. There are only
two passenger trains a day on this line."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to get back before to-night,"
said Dave, decidedly. "We've got to get back
right now."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you are going to do it," said
the boy. "Ain't no train, nor stage, nor nuthin."</p>

<p>"Can't we hire some sort of a carriage?" queried
Babcock. "We won't mind the expense." He
came from a well-to-do family and had ample
spending money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Might git old Si Ross to drive you over."</p>

<p>"Who is Si Ross?"</p>

<p>"Used to run the stage from here to Leeton before
the railroad went through."</p>

<p>"Will you show us his place?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered the boy and took them
through the lumber town and to a small shanty on
the outskirts. Here they found Si Ross, a bent-over
old man who was rather hard of hearing.</p>

<p>"Hi, Si!" called out the boy. "These fellers
want you to drive 'em over to Leeton."</p>

<p>"They're arrivin' from Leeton?" queried the
old man.</p>

<p>"No, they want you to drive 'em over&mdash;<i>drive
'em over</i>!" shrieked the boy.</p>

<p>"Me drive 'em over?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dave and Babcock at the top of
their voices, and nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>"Cost ye two an' a half."</p>

<p>"All right. Can you do it right away?" went
on Dave.</p>

<p>"O' course I know the way."</p>

<p>"Can you do it <i>right away</i>!" screamed Dave.</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;soon as I kin hitch up."</p>

<p>"<i>Hurry up!</i>" yelled Babcock. "We want to get
there as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I'll git ye there soon enough, don't ye fear,"
said Si Ross, and hobbled off to his barn. He
brought forth a bony horse and shoved out a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

rickety road wagon and began to hook up. The
boy helped him.</p>

<p>"That doesn't look very promising," remarked
Babcock.</p>

<p>"Is this the best turnout in town?" asked Dave,
of the boy.</p>

<p>"It's the only one you can git," was the answer.</p>

<p>At last Si Ross was ready to leave and the two
students got up on the rear seat of the wagon, Dave
first giving the boy ten cents for his trouble, which
pleased the urchin immensely. Then Si Ross
pulled himself to the front seat, provided himself
with a fresh chew of tobacco, and took up the reins.</p>

<p>"Gee dap!" he squeaked to the bony horse and
the animal started off on a walk. Then the driver
cracked his whip and soon the steed was making
fairly good time over the lonely country road.</p>

<p>Again the boys consulted their watches and
found it was now half-past one o'clock. The football
game was scheduled to start at half-past three.</p>

<p>"Two hours to get there in," said Dave. "We'll
never make it."</p>

<p>"I think we ought to start for Mr. Mongrace's
place direct," said Babcock.</p>

<p>"But we haven't our football togs."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Roger will take them along, or we
may be able to borrow some. One thing is certain,
we haven't time to return to Oak Hall for
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know where Mr. Mongrace's estate
is?" asked Dave, in a loud tone of the driver.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;very fine place," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Can you take us there?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"<i>Can you take us there?</i>"</p>

<p>"Sure. But I thought you wanted to go to Leeton?"</p>

<p>"We must get to Mr. Mongrace's by half-past
three!" called out Dave.</p>

<p>"I can make it&mdash;but we'll have to hurry."</p>

<p>"Go ahead then."</p>

<p>"Three dollars."</p>

<p>"<i>All right!</i>" yelled Babcock, and felt in his
pocket. "Oh, pshaw! I've only got a dollar and
a quarter with me!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, I've got it," said Dave, and
brought out the necessary bank bills.</p>

<p>The sight of the cash was inspiring to Si Ross,
and he urged his bony nag along at a faster gait
than ever. They passed over one small hill and
then came out on a highway which was in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know who put us in that freight
car," said Dave, as they rattled along. "Do you
know, I've half an idea the whole thing was a put-up
job. That tree seemed to fall down right in
front of us and I don't see what should make it
fall. There was hardly any wind blowing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was certainly a curious piece of business all
the way through," returned Paul Babcock. "We'll
have to start an investigation after the game. And
we must try to recover our bicycles too."</p>

<p>"Do you think any of the Rockville fellows
would be mean enough to play such a trick on us?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Whoever it was took big
chances. Why, we might have been killed!"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't done by footpads, otherwise we
should have been robbed."</p>

<p>"That is true. Well, the best thing we can&mdash;&mdash;Whoa!
What's the matter!"</p>

<p>"The horse is running away!"</p>

<p>"The back-strap is broken!"</p>

<p>There was no time to say more, for the wagon
was swaying from side to side. Then came a turn,
and a second later the vehicle ran off into a gully.
Crash! went one of the front wheels, and over
went the body. The horse came to a standstill
and Si Ross slid into some bushes, followed by the
two students.</p>

<p>"Smashed!" wailed the old driver, as he got up
and surveyed the wreck.</p>

<p>"And that ends our hope of getting to the football
field in time," added Babcock dolefully.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
<span class="small">OFF FOR THE GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Where</span></span> in the world can Dave and Paul be
keeping themselves?"</p>

<p>It was Roger who spoke. He and the others
had had their dinner and were out on the campus
doing a last bit of practising before starting for
Mr. Mongrace's place.</p>

<p>"They certainly should have been here long
ago," returned Phil. "They won't have time to
get their dinner."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Gus Plum and his crowd met them
on the road," said Sam. "They were out on their
wheels."</p>

<p>"I'll ask them," said Shadow, and ran off to do
so. He met Nat Poole at the doorway to the
Hall.</p>

<p>"Say, Nat, did you see anything of Dave Porter
and Paul Babcock when you were out on your
wheel?" he asked.</p>

<p>Nat Poole started at the direct question and his
face changed color. But he quickly recovered.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see them," he answered. "What
makes you ask?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are missing and I know you were out on
your wheel and they went out too&mdash;over to Leeton."</p>

<p>"We went to Oakdale," said Nat, and turned
away, for fear of being questioned further. He,
Plum, and Jasniff had arranged it between them
to say they had been to Oakdale and nowhere
else.</p>

<p>Shadow Hamilton returned to his friends and
related what Poole had said. Some of the students
had already departed for the football field, going
on their wheels and in one of the carriages belonging
to the place. The football club was to take
the carryall, and turnouts had been engaged for all
who were to witness the game.</p>

<p>Soon Andrew Dale came out to see if the team
was ready. He was greatly surprised when he
learned that Dave and Paul were missing.</p>

<p>"It may be they have been delayed," said he,
"and if that is so, they may have gone direct from
Leeton to the Mongrace estate. I think there is a
fairly good road."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is so," answered the senator's son,
brightening a little. "But they ought to have
come here&mdash;they knew I should be worried."</p>

<p>"You had better take their suits along. We
can leave word here about the suits&mdash;in case they
come after we are gone."</p>

<p>Swiftly the minutes went by until the club could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

wait no longer. Then into the carryall they piled,
regulars and substitutes, taking the outfits of the
missing players with them. Jackson Lemond was
to drive, and with a crack of the whip they were
off. Usually the boys would have been noisy and
full of fun, but now they were sober.</p>

<p>"Paul told me he would surely be back," said
Henshaw. "I am afraid something has happened
to him."</p>

<p>"Maybe they got a tumble," suggested Buster
Beggs. "But it would be queer if they both got
caught at the same time."</p>

<p>The boys had brought their horns and rattles
with them, yet they made little noise as they rode
along, much to the satisfaction of Jackson Lemond,
who had been afraid they would scare the horses
and cause them to bolt. Yet the Hall driver was
sorry to see them so blue.</p>

<p>"Ain't feelin' much like playin', I take it," he observed.</p>

<p>"It is not that, Horsehair," answered Roger.
"We are alarmed over the absence of Dave Porter
and Paul Babcock."</p>

<p>"Got to have 'em to play, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, they belong on the regular eleven."</p>

<p>"Maybe they went ahead," said the Hall driver,
hopefully.</p>

<p>The roads were in good condition, and soon they
reached the broad highway leading directly to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

Mongrace estate. On this road they met a score
of turnouts all bound for the football field.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! There are the Oak Hall fellows!"</p>

<p>"Hope you win, boys!"</p>

<p>"You've got to put up a stiff game if you want to
come out ahead this season. Rockville has got a
dandy team."</p>

<p>So the cries ran on, while horns were blown and
rattles used. Then a big stage lumbered up,
carrying a number of students from Rockville in
their natty military uniforms.</p>

<p>"This is the time we'll wax you!"</p>

<p>"After this game Oak Hall won't be in it!"</p>

<p>"Bet you two to one we beat you!"</p>

<p>"Bet your small change on that, or you'll be a
beggar!" cried one of the Oak Hall boys in return.</p>

<p>"We'll race you to the grounds!" said a Rockville
student. "Get up there!" he cried to the
horses pulling the stage. The whip was used and
the turnout bounded ahead.</p>

<p>"Here, this won't do, Horsehair!" cried Phil.
"We can't let them beat us on the road like this.
Start up the team."</p>

<p>Now, if there was one thing that Lemond took
pride in, it was his horses, and seldom was it that
he allowed anybody to pass him on the road. Dr.
Clay kept good animals, and Horsehair saw to it
that they were always in the best of condition.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

Moreover, he and the driver for Rockville were as
bitter rivals as the students themselves.</p>

<p>"Ain't goin' to pass us to-day!" said he, setting
his teeth. "Git up!" and he snapped his whip in
a manner that meant business.</p>

<p>The horses understood, and in a moment more
a race was on in earnest. Stage and carryall
streaked down the broad road side by side, all of
the students shrieking themselves hoarse.</p>

<p>"Go it, Horsehair! Don't let them beat us!"</p>

<p>"Send 'em ahead, Jerry! We can't take the
dust of Oak Hall!"</p>

<p>Faster and faster went stage and carryall and
now the two drivers settled down to the race in
earnest. Then came a turn and the Oak Hall
turnout shot ahead.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Horsehair!" yelled Phil.
"Keep it up!"</p>

<p>"Catch him, Jerry, catch him!" came from behind.</p>

<p>"You can't catch us to-day!" flung back Buster
Beggs. "Good-by! We'll tell 'em you are coming!"
Then the carryall swept up to some private
carriages, passed them, and left the Rockville stage
in the dust of the road behind.</p>

<p>The little brush served to brighten up Roger
and his companions, and as they drew close to the
football field they blew their horns and sounded
their rattles. When they swept into the grounds

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

they were greeted with cheers, and Oak Hall flags
were waved everywhere.</p>

<p>It was certainly a fine football field, as level as a
house floor and well roped off. To one side was a
neat grand stand, painted green and white, and
decorated with flags and bunting. At the far end
of the field was a big tent, where the refreshments
were to be served, and opposite the grand stand
was a special inclosure for any outsiders who cared
to witness the contest. Each school was well
represented by its followers, and there were fully a
thousand spectators in addition.</p>

<p>"We couldn't have a nicer day nor a better
crowd," remarked Phil, as he gazed around.</p>

<p>"Do you see anything of Dave and Paul?" questioned
Roger, anxiously.</p>

<p>All looked around quickly and then hurried to
the dressing room under the grand stand. Not a
sign of the missing players was to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>"We've got fifteen minutes yet," said Roger.
"They may show up at any minute."</p>

<p>"Are all the Rockville players here?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they look as if they meant business,
too," answered Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>The grand stand had been divided into three
parts, the middle for the owner of the estate and his
special friends, and either end for the two schools.
In the best position on the stand was the sick

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>

brother of the owner of the estate, propped up in
an invalid's chair. His face wore a smile, as if he
enjoyed everything that was going on.</p>

<p>In an extreme corner of the Oak Hall end of the
stand sat Gus Plum, Nat Poole, and Nick Jasniff.
They were awaiting the outcome of the game with
deep interest, although sure that their school would
lose. Through a friend in Oakdale they had
placed practically all their spending money on bets
in favor of Rockville,&mdash;in fact Gus Plum had gone
into debt twenty dollars, borrowing the amount
from a student named Chadworth.</p>

<p>"Say, are you sure you fixed Henshaw?" whispered
the bully of the Hall to Jasniff. "He
doesn't look to be very sick or dizzy-headed."</p>

<p>"Oh, I fixed him right enough," returned Nick
Jasniff. "Maybe the stuff hasn't had time to
work."</p>

<p>"Or maybe you didn't give him enough," commented
Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"I gave him the dose called for. Of course I
didn't dare to give him too much."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything of Porter or Babcock,"
went on Poole, with a side wink at his cronies.</p>

<p>"No, it's funny where they are," answered Gus
Plum, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"Maybe they got afraid to play," added Jasniff,
in an equally loud tone.</p>

<p>It soon became noised around that Dave and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

Paul had failed to show themselves, and Dr. Clay
himself came from the grand stand to see about it.
But nobody could give him any information.</p>

<p>"Something must have happened to detain
them," said the owner of the Hall. "They would
certainly get here if they could."</p>

<p>At last it was time to go out on the field for
practice. Henshaw was put in Babcock's place,
as he was able to play the position almost as well
as anybody, and a lad named Farrell took the position
reserved for Dave.</p>

<p>"There goes Henshaw out," said Nat Poole, in
a low voice. "He seems to be all right."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't he be all right?" demanded a
student sitting behind the speaker.</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking to you, Dodd."</p>

<p>"Well, why shouldn't Henshaw be all right?"
insisted Dodd.</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;er&mdash;somebody said he wasn't feeling
well, that's all," stammered Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"He told me he was feeling bang-up."</p>

<p>"That so? Well, I'm glad to hear it," said
Poole, weakly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Henshaw was feeling just a
bit faint and dizzy, the drug not having had time
to have its full effect. Luckily the lad was strong
and with a good heart action, so he was bound to
suffer less than had he been otherwise.</p>

<p>There was a cheer for the Oak Hall players and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

another cheer when the Rockville eleven appeared
on the field. The practice of each team was
snappy and vigorous and brought forth applause.</p>

<p>The umpire and the referee were college men,
chosen by Mr. Dale and a teacher from Rockville,
and the linesmen were others acceptable all around.
The practice over, there was a five minutes' intermission.</p>

<p>"Dave and Babcock are not here yet," sighed
Phil, "I declare, it's too bad! If we have many
accidents on the field we'll be more than short-handed."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't stay away of their own accord,"
said Roger. "Something is wrong&mdash;I'm
dead sure of it."</p>

<p>It had been decided that the two halves of the
game should be of thirty minutes each, with an
intermission of ten minutes. Roger, Phil, Ben,
and Buster Beggs occupied the positions they had
filled the season previous, and the others of the
eleven were placed to the best advantage. The
center and the right guard were a little weak, but
this could not be helped. On the other hand, the
Rockville eleven appeared to be exceptionally well
balanced.</p>

<p>"Time to play!" cried Phil, presently, and the
eleven at once took their positions. Then the
Rockville men came on the field once more; and a
minute later the great game started.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE GREAT FOOTBALL GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">At</span></span> the best it is next to impossible to describe all
the plays made in a fast and snappy football game,
and I shall not attempt to do so. From the very
outset Rockville Academy demonstrated the fact
that they had come to win or die trying, and they
were alert to a degree that brought forth admiration
even from their enemies.</p>

<p>The toss-up was won by Rockville, and the center
kicked off amid a breathless silence. The
leather sailed in Sam Day's direction and he caught
it and brought it back twelve yards. Ben Basswood
was called to kick and sent it off to the forty-five-yard
line. It was caught, but lost to Phil
Lawrence, who managed to tear around the end
for five yards. Then followed a mix-up, and the
ball went back and forth four times, when it went
out of bounds and brought a loss to Rockville of
two yards.</p>

<p>The whole crowd by this time was wild with excitement,
and every advance by one side or the
other was hailed with cheers, the tooting of horns,
and the swinging of rattles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Phew! but this is hard work, sure enough,"
whispered Phil to Roger. "They are pushing
things for all they are worth."</p>

<p>"I believe they think they can wind us," answered
the senator's son.</p>

<p>The ball was put into play a few seconds later.
"Twelve, twenty-six, fifty!" was the signal, and it
passed rapidly from one Rockville player to another.
Then came a sensational run of twenty
yards, the tackle with the ball rushing Oak Hall's
left end. But the fullback was after him and
brought him down just as it looked as if Rockville
might score a touchdown.</p>

<p>"Say, look at that run!"</p>

<p>"I thought he was going to make it, sure!"</p>

<p>"So did I!"</p>

<p>"They'll get it anyway, see if they don't!"</p>

<p>So the cries ran on as the two elevens lined up
for the next scrimmage. The first half was now
eighteen minutes old, and exactly two minutes later,
despite the best efforts of Oak Hall, the leather
was forced over the line by the military academy
boys.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! A touchdown for Rockville!"</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it!"</p>

<p>And then the crowd cheered harder than ever&mdash;that
is, those who sympathized with the military
academy. Oak Hall and its supporters sat silent,
and a few shook their heads and sighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you?" whispered Nick Jasniff, to
Plum and Poole. "There's the first dose. That
money is as good as won!"</p>

<p>"It suits me right enough," answered the bully
of Oak Hall. He did not add that he was very
low on cash and that his father had written, stating
that he could not supply Gus with any more spending
money for a long time to come.</p>

<p>As soon as the touchdown was made the leather
was hurried to the field for a kick. It sailed
directly between the goal posts, and at this another
yell went up.</p>

<p>"Six points for Rockville! That's the way to
do it!"</p>

<p>"Now then for another, fellows! Show 'em
that is only a starter!"</p>

<p>With eight more minutes of the first half left the
ball was put into play and once more it was sent
back and forth. Once Roger made a clever run of
fifteen yards and at another time, when a Rockville
player made a fumble, Phil snatched the ball,
sent it to Ben, who turned it over to Henshaw.
With the leather in his arm Henshaw made a brave
attempt for a touchdown, but was stopped on the
thirty-yard line. His run, however, was loudly
applauded, and for the time being it gave Jasniff,
Plum, and Poole a chill.</p>

<p>"Phew!" muttered Plum. "I thought he was
going straight over!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's the best player they've got," whispered
Jasniff. "I can't understand why that drug doesn't
work."</p>

<p>But the drug was working, and it was that which
prevented Henshaw from making the touchdown
after covering twenty yards. He was growing
more dizzy each moment.</p>

<p>"I must be getting the blind staggers," he said
to Roger. "Everything seems to be swimming in
front of my eyes."</p>

<p>"Maybe you ran too hard," suggested the senator's
son.</p>

<p>"No, I've been feeling that way for the past five
minutes. I don't know what's the matter with
me."</p>

<p>"Do you want to quit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll try to play the half out," answered
Henshaw.</p>

<p>With the ball on the thirty-yard line, Oak Hall
fought as never before to carry the leather on. It
did go down to the twenty-yard line, but only to be
lost on a fumble, after which a succession of brilliant
rushes and end runs by Rockville brought it
within striking distance of Oak Hall's goal line,
when a drop kick sent it once more between the
posts.</p>

<p>"Will you look at that!"</p>

<p>"A goal from the field! That gives Rockville
10 points!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The cheering and the general din were tremendous.
Oak Hall had nothing to say. Plum and
his cronies chuckled to themselves.</p>

<p>"Rockville is rubbing it in, eh?" chuckled Nick
Jasniff. "I hope they make it about 50 to 0!"</p>

<p>"So do I," answered Nat Poole.</p>

<p>Once more the ball went into play, and this time
Oak Hall sent it into the Rockville territory in a
grim, stone-wall way that could not be resisted.
But when it lacked still ten yards of the goal line,
the whistle blew, telling that time was up and the
first half of the game had come to an end.</p>

<p>"Hard luck to-day," said Phil, grimly. "They
are certainly putting up a great game."</p>

<p>"They have more weight than we have," answered
Shadow. "And I must say, their tackling
is first-class."</p>

<p>"I think it is rough," said Buster Beggs. "I got
a kick in the shin that wasn't pleasant."</p>

<p>"That Hausermann is rather rough," said Phil.
"I'd hate to have him come down on me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he plays off-side," said Roger. "I
had to warn him twice, and the referee warned him
too."</p>

<p>Poor Henshaw was now so dizzy he could
scarcely stand and two of the other players had to
escort him off the field. Andrew Dale questioned
the youth closely.</p>

<p>"You didn't eat or drink anything unusual?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that I know of, sir."</p>

<p>"Did you ever feel that way before when
playing?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it never affected me in the least."</p>

<p>"It is odd. I will call Dr. Blarcom, who is
present."</p>

<p>The doctor came up and made a close examination.
He was much puzzled. He also asked
Henshaw about his eating and drinking. Then,
when the lad complained of feeling sick at the
stomach, he gave him an emetic.</p>

<p>"He has certainly swallowed something that
hasn't agreed with him," said the physician, and
took Henshaw to the Mongrace mansion, where he
might give the sick student every attention.</p>

<p>With Henshaw, Babcock, and Dave out of the
game, Roger hardly knew what to do for players.
The lad who had taken Dave's place was only an
ordinary player, and to put another ordinary player
in place of Henshaw would be to weaken the eleven
greatly.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks like a walk-over for Rockville,"
said the senator's son. "I can't understand
what is keeping Dave and Paul away."</p>

<p>But four minutes of the intermission had passed
when there came a sudden shout from outside of
the grand-stand dressing rooms. Then with a
whirr a big red automobile dashed up and two
dusty-looking youths leaped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dave and Paul!" ejaculated Phil, joyously.
"Where in the world have you been?"</p>

<p>"Is the game over?" asked Dave, anxiously.</p>

<p>"The first half is."</p>

<p>"What's the score?" questioned Babcock,
quickly.</p>

<p>"10 to 0 against us."</p>

<p>"Is that so!"</p>

<p>"But where have you been?" demanded Roger,
and added, almost in the same breath: "Can you
play?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we can play&mdash;that is what we are
here for," returned Dave. "Will somebody lend
me a football suit?"</p>

<p>"We have your suits here," said Shadow, and
brought them forth. "Climb right in."</p>

<p>Dave and Babcock did "climb in," and while
doing so briefly related their adventures.</p>

<p>"When the old wagon went to smash we thought
we were surely out of the game," said Dave. "But
a few minutes later a man came along in that automobile,
and we stopped him and got him to promise
to bring us here. We would have gotten here in
time for the first half only something got the matter
with the auto's batteries."</p>

<p>"Dave, some enemies played that trick," said
Phil.</p>

<p>"No doubt of it."</p>

<p>"They wanted us to lose the game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," said Babcock.</p>

<p>"Do you suspect any of the Rockville fellows?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I am going to investigate after this
game is over."</p>

<p>"And I am going to investigate, too," added
Dave. "Why, we might have been killed!"</p>

<p>The youth who had taken Dave's place on the
eleven was perfectly willing to retire, feeling that
Oak Hall was going to lose anyway. Babcock
took his old place.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for Spud," he said, referring to
Henshaw. "It appears to me that something is
wrong all around."</p>

<p>With the appearance of Dave and Babcock the
spirits of Roger, Phil, and the others arose wonderfully.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, play for all you are worth," said
the senator's son. "Make every scrimmage count,
and if you get hold of the ball run like all-possessed.
We must get something this half, or we'll
never hear the end of it."</p>

<p>"It will certainly make Gus Plum and his cronies
crow," answered Dave, grimly. "I suppose they
are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a corner of the stand," answered Buster
Beggs.</p>

<p>"They were out on their wheels this morning,"
said Sam Day. "Did you see anything of
them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"They were out?" repeated Dave, in surprise.
"Did they follow us?"</p>

<p>"They said they went to Oakdale."</p>

<p>Dave looked at Paul Babcock, who pursed up
his lips meditatively.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Paul?"</p>

<p>"I think it will stand investigation," answered
Babcock. "Somebody played us the trick, and it
certainly wasn't a friend."</p>

<p>"Last year Plum and Poole were against us."</p>

<p>At that moment came a call from the doorway
of the dressing room.</p>

<p>"Time for the second half, boys. Come out on
the field."</p>

<p>It had become noised around that Dave and
Babcock had arrived. A number believed this,
but others did not.</p>

<p>"Do you think it is true?" demanded Plum of
Jasniff.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can be," whispered Jasniff in
return. "They must have been carried miles and
miles on that freight train."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only talk," grumbled Nat Poole.</p>

<p>The eleven were now pouring into the field.
Among the first to show themselves were Dave and
Paul, and a roar of welcome went up from the Oak
Hall supporters.</p>

<p>"There are Porter and Babcock!"</p>

<p>"Now for some real playing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where in the world have they been?"</p>

<p>"They are here, sure enough!" whispered Gus
Plum, hoarsely. "Nick, what can it mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me," growled Jasniff. "It beats
anything I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>As soon as they came on the field Dave and Babcock
reported to the referee, as substitutes for the
two players that had dropped out. Then the
whistle blew, and the second half of the great game
was on.</p>

<span class="small">HOW THE GAME ENDED</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">There</span></span> was another spell of breathless silence as
the ball went into play on the second half of the
great game. The kick-off was clean and clever,
and for several minutes the leather remained close
to the center of the field, each eleven struggling
desperately to force the line of the other. Rockville
had had one man slightly hurt and another
player had taken his place, one who was light and
very wiry. He took the ball for a run around the
left end, but was brought down. Then in the
scrimmage that followed the ball came to Dave
and he made a gain of ten yards, breaking through
and dodging in a manner that brought forth much
favorable comment.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it," was the cry. "Carry
it over the line!"</p>

<p>But alas! for the hopes of Oak Hall. In the
very next mix-up Buster Beggs made a bad fumble
and the wiry substitute on the Rockville eleven secured
the leather. Before anybody could stop

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

him he made a sensational run to the end of the
field.</p>

<p>"Another touchdown for Rockville!"</p>

<p>How the supporters of the military academy did
cheer and yell! Horns tooted madly and the
academy colors went waving in all directions.</p>

<p>Gus Plum grinned silently, while Nick Jasniff
winked at him.</p>

<p>"Say, we're all right, after all, eh?" whispered
Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"Hush!" muttered the bully of the school. "If
our fellows should hear you they'd kill us! This
defeat will make them ugly."</p>

<p>The touchdown was turned into a goal, giving
Rockville 16 points as against 0 for Oak Hall.
Things certainly did look blue.</p>

<p>"Come, fellows, we've got to do something!"
urged Roger. "Everybody play for all he is
worth. Don't let a single chance escape you!"</p>

<p>"I am going to do something if I die for it," said
Babcock, and went in with a vigor that nothing
could resist. Inside of two minutes he secured the
ball, dove to the left, turned, and started for the
right. Two Rockville players tackled him, but
Dave and Buster Beggs came between and Babcock
went on. Then Roger took a hand, and in the
struggle the ball went over the Rockville line amid
a yelling from Oak Hall that could have been
heard half a mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"A touchdown for Oak Hall!"</p>

<p>"Now wake up, boys, and show 'em what you
can do!"</p>

<p>Dave held the ball and Roger made the kick.
The ball went through the posts fairly, scoring 6
points for the Hall. Again came a cheer.</p>

<p>"Well, it's only 6 to 16," whispered Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"How much longer to play?" asked Plum.</p>

<p>"Fourteen minutes."</p>

<p>The six points gained put increased vigor into
Oak Hall, and now Roger gave the signal for a
certain mass play which had as yet not been tried.
Like a living wedge Oak Hall struck against Rockville,
and although the academy eleven carried
more weight they could not withstand such an onslaught.
They separated, and in a twinkling the
leather was carried up the field and across the line
a second time, within three minutes after the first
touchdown was secured.</p>

<p>"Whoop! Hurrah! Look at that!"</p>

<p>"Another touchdown! Keep it up, fellows!"</p>

<p>"Oak Hall has struck her gait at last!"</p>

<p>And then the Oak Hall colors were waved
wildly, while horns tooted and rattles were swung
on every side. It was now Rockville's turn to remain
silent.</p>

<p>"Be careful, fellows, don't get excited," warned
Roger. "Watch your chances."</p>

<p>The goal was kicked, making the score, Rockville

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>

16, Oak Hall 12. There were but eight
minutes more in which to play. Once again the
leather came into the field. Rockville was now on
guard against another mass play and it was decided
to try the left end. The ball went to Ben, who
passed it to Dave. Dave made a short run and
doubled, as if turning back. Then he plunged
forward, hurdled (it was the old style of playing),
and tore up the field for twenty yards. Then he
was brought to earth with a thud that made his
ears ring and caused him to see stars.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, Dave?" he heard Roger ask,
and sitting up he shook his head. Time had been
called, and he learned that for two minutes he had
been dead to the world.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess I am all right," he said, and with a
mighty effort pulled himself together. "Did&mdash;did
I gain anything?"</p>

<p>"Did you gain anything? Well, rather!" answered
Phil. "It was a dandy play!"</p>

<p>Again the ball was put into play, and it went
back and forth in a manner that was heartbreaking,
first for one side and then for the other. Then
came a warning cry:</p>

<p>"Three minutes more to play!"</p>

<p>It nerved all of the players up as never before
and the struggle was the most bitter yet. But
with less than a minute and a half to play Dave secured
the ball and made a clever pass to Phil, who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>

started up the field. Babcock guarded him on one
side and Roger on the other, and in a trice another
sensational run was on.</p>

<p>"Down him! Down him!" was the frantic
yell from Rockville, and just as Phil, panting for
breath, reached the goal-line he was caught and
thrown with tremendous violence, his head striking
the ground with great force.</p>

<p>"Another touchdown!"</p>

<p>"Oak Hall wins the game!"</p>

<p>It was true, the touchdown had been made, fairly
and squarely. With drooping hearts Rockville
came out of the mix-up. There was nothing more
to be done, for all but quarter of a minute of the
time was up. Phil lay on the ball motionless, his
face buried in the grass.</p>

<p>"He's hurt!" cried Dave, bending over his
chum. "Phil!"</p>

<p>There was no answer, and now Roger and some
others came to the aid of the fallen one. They
turned Phil over. His face was pale and his eyes
closed. He made not the slightest sound.</p>

<p>"Call the doctor!" said Dave, in as steady a
voice as he could command. "I&mdash;I hope he isn't
hurt very much."</p>

<p>Water was brought and Phil's face was bathed,
but still he made no sound nor did he open his eyes.
Then the doctor came up and took charge.</p>

<p>"He has received a severe shock," said the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>

physician, after an examination. "As yet I cannot
tell how badly he is affected. His head is bleeding,
and it is possible he may have fractured his
skull. We had best remove him to the house."</p>

<p>A barn door was procured and a blanket thrown
over it, and on this the hurt student was placed and
six others carried him to the mansion. In the
meantime there had been a great cheering over
Oak Hall's victory, but this soon came to an end
when it was known that Phil Lawrence had been
seriously hurt.</p>

<p>"I hope his skull hasn't been fractured," said
Dave. "He certainly came down hard. I heard
the thump plainly."</p>

<p>"So did I," answered Babcock, and then he ran
off to see how Henshaw was faring. He found
the latter sitting up in an easy-chair, as pale as
death itself.</p>

<p>"Won out, eh?" said Henshaw, weakly. "Good
enough!"</p>

<p>"How do you feel now?" questioned Babcock.</p>

<p>"Oh, my stomach is better and the dizziness is
gone. But I am as weak as a rag."</p>

<p>Through an attendant Henshaw had heard of
the arrival of Dave and Babcock and of the
progress of the great game. He was shocked to
learn that Phil had been seriously hurt.</p>

<p>"This will put a damper on the celebration,"
said he, and he was right. Only a few cared to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

celebrate with Phil, for all they knew, lying at
death's door. The sufferer was still unconscious,
and a messenger had been sent off for another
physician who was also a surgeon.</p>

<p>"This takes the edge off the victory," said
Dave. "I'd rather lose than have anybody seriously
hurt."</p>

<p>"Morr, we are mighty sorry for this," said the
captain of the Rockville eleven, coming up. "I
am sure you know it wasn't done intentionally."</p>

<p>"I know that," answered Roger. "But the play
was pretty rough, especially towards the end."</p>

<p>"It was a fair tackle," said the Rockville captain,
and moved off.</p>

<p>Those from the military academy felt their defeat
keenly. Just when they had thought victory
certain all their hopes had been dashed to the
ground. They had to admit that Oak Hall had
played fairly from start to finish.</p>

<p>"Boys, you did splendidly," said Dr. Clay.
"The one dark spot is the fact that Lawrence has
been hurt. I sincerely trust it does not prove
serious."</p>

<p>While the doctor was doing what he could for
Phil, the two schools were entertained in royal
style by Mr. Mongrace. But Dave and Roger
could eat little, their thoughts being constantly
with Phil. Three others who did not enjoy the
feast were Plum, Poole, and Jasniff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang the luck, anyway!" growled the bully, as
he and his cronies walked away from the table.
"Jasniff, this is the worst yet."</p>

<p>"Who would have thought that they could pull
themselves together like that," grumbled Jasniff.
"Why, I never saw such work on any field. They
went at the play like demons&mdash;nothing could stand
before them."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Phil Lawrence got a broken head for
his pains," said Poole, in a tone more of satisfaction
than regret.</p>

<p>"I don't care a continental for Lawrence," pursued
the bully of Oak Hall. "What I am thinking
of is the money I have lost."</p>

<p>"And the money I've lost, too," added
Poole.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to pocket our losses, that's
all," answered Jasniff. "With Porter, Babcock,
and Henshaw off the list I thought we'd make a
sure thing of it&mdash;but we didn't, and there you
are."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I am going to do about the
money I put up," said Gus Plum.</p>

<p>"Write to your old man for some," suggested
Jasniff. "Tell him you lost your money, but don't
say how."</p>

<p>"He won't let me have any more just yet&mdash;said
so in his last letter."</p>

<p>"How about you, Nat?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"My old man won't give up a cent until next
allowance day, and that's two weeks off. I'll have
to live on air till then."</p>

<p>A little later Poole was called away by one of
the students, and Gus Plum and Nick Jasniff were
left to themselves. Plum was in a quandary, for
he had borrowed from several parties and now did
not know how to pay the amounts back. Jasniff
noticed his uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Don't take the loss so hard, Gus," he said.
"Let us go off and have a smoke&mdash;it will settle
your nerves. If we were in town we might get a
drink. But we can't get it around here."</p>

<p>"Let's go back to the Hall, I am sick of it here,"
answered the bully of the school; and a few minutes
later he and Jasniff started off, leaving Poole behind,
in the company of several girls who had
driven in to witness the football match. Poole
always dressed very fastidiously, and sought the
company of the girls whenever the opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>Halfway to Oak Hall, Plum and Jasniff determined
to ride on their wheels to Hampton, a
small village south of Oakdale. Here they put up
at the tavern, and Jasniff spent his last twenty cents
for some liquor. Then they sat down in the back
room, to smoke cigarettes and talk over their
future plans.</p>

<p>"It don't feel nice to be dead-broke," said

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

Jasniff. "Wouldn't you like to earn a little pile,
Gus?"</p>

<p>"How?" questioned the bully eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;I don't know exactly," drawled Jasniff,
looking up at the ceiling. "But it might be done,
you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to get money somehow," answered
Plum, desperately. "I am not going
around without a cent in my pocket, and in debt,
too."</p>

<p>"Will you stand by me if I show you a way to
get a little pile?" asked Jasniff, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," answered Plum, boldly.</p>

<p>"All right, then; I'll let you know what I can do
in a few days. I've got to consult somebody else
first, though."</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">A FUNNY INITIATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">The</span></span> celebration to follow the grand victory was
a rather tame affair on account of the accident to
Phil Lawrence. The ship-owner's son was a prime
favorite with many of the Oak Hall students and
they asked about him constantly.</p>

<p>"He cannot be moved at present," said the doctors.
"He must remain here." And after that
the sufferer was made as comfortable as possible in
one of the spare chambers of the mansion. A telegram
was at once sent to his parents, and they came
on the following morning. Poor Phil was still unconscious
but came to his senses that evening, and
by the following day seemed a trifle improved.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do hope he gets over it entirely," said
Dave to Roger. "It would be awful to think of
his suffering all his life."</p>

<p>"That is true, Dave. I'd rather we hadn't
played at all."</p>

<p>"And to think it came at the very end of the
game," broke in Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>"It will stop football for this season," announced

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

Sam Day, and he was right. Dr. Clay
issued orders that very day that no more games
should be played until it was certain that Phil was
out of danger. Even as it was, a number of the
students received word from their parents and
guardians forbidding their playing any more.</p>

<p>Dave wrote to his uncle and to the others about
the game, and received several letters in return,
including one from Jessie Wadsworth which he
kept to himself and prized very highly. In it the
girl wrote that she was glad they had won and was
sure Dave had done his full share to gain the victory,
but she was sorry to learn Phil had been hurt
and that Dave must be sure to keep out of harm.</p>

<p>"We cannot afford to have anything happen to
you," wrote Jessie, "for we all think so much of
you." And this made Dave's cheeks flush and his
heart beat with keenest pleasure.</p>

<p>The letter from Dunston Porter was also interesting,
but one paragraph made Dave's heart sink.
In this Mr. Porter stated that as yet no word of
any kind had been received about Dave's father
and sister.</p>

<p>"It certainly is queer you don't hear from them,"
said Roger, when he learned of this. "If they are
in Europe or in America at least one of your letters
must have followed them up."</p>

<p>"It's a mystery to me," answered Dave, and
heaved a long sigh. He was more than impatient

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

to meet his father and sister, and who can blame
him?</p>

<p>The two bicycles belonging to Dave and Babcock
had been brought in by a farmer of that vicinity,
who had found them near the fallen tree. This
man was rewarded for his trouble, and Dave,
Roger, and Babcock went to the spot hoping to find
some clew to the mystery. They saw that the tree
was decayed near the roots but that it had undoubtedly
been broken off by force.</p>

<p>"It was surely the work of some enemies," said
Dave. "The question is, Who is guilty?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll learn some day," answered the
senator's son; and there, for the time being, the
subject was dropped.</p>

<p>As my old readers know there was a secret society
at Oak Hall known as the Gee Eyes, this
mysterious appellation standing for the initials,
G. I., which in their turn stood for the words,
Guess It. This society had its officers and its secret
password, and met "semi-occasionally or oftener"
as the by-laws had it. It was gotten up mostly for
fun,&mdash;the said fun being largely due to the initiation
of new members. Dave had joined and so
had his chums, and they had aided in initiating a
number of others.</p>

<p>For various reasons Plum, Poole, and Jasniff
were out of this society. When Jasniff had
wanted to join&mdash;as a newcomer to the Hall&mdash;he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>

had been rejected with scant ceremony. This had
angered him, and as a consequence he and his
cronies, along with several other students, had organized
a new society, called the D. D. A. Club,
the initials standing for Dare Do Anything. This
was supposed to meet once a month, and all sorts
of inducements were offered to get the other students
to join.</p>

<p>"I hear the Gee Eyes are going to meet soon,"
said Nat Poole, one day to his cronies. "Ain't it
about time the D. D. A. met too?"</p>

<p>"Have you found a new member?" asked Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Frank Bond wants to join."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's only a little fellow," sneered Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Never mind, we can get some fun out of him,"
said Gus Plum. "I'd like something to do.
Things are dead slow."</p>

<p>The Gee Eyes met the very next night, and hearing
of this the D. D. A. Club did the same. A
new student named Sultzer&mdash;a German boy&mdash;wanted
to join the Gee Eyes, and Dave and Ben
Basswood were appointed as a committee of two to
make ready for the occasion.</p>

<p>"We'll have to give 'em something brand-new,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"That will not be so easy&mdash;since we have tried
nearly everything," answered Dave.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="Carl_was_made_to_bow"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are building a new house over near the
Grislow place. Can't we do something there?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we can," said Dave. "Let us look over
the ground."</p>

<p>By the time the Gee Eyes met everything was in
readiness, and Ben Basswood brought Carl Sultzer
to the meeting, which was held in an old boathouse
down the river. In the meantime the other members
had attired themselves in cotton robes of red,
with black hoods over their heads and a yellow
tassel dangling over one ear. Some had wooden
swords, one a wooden hammer, and others stuffed
clubs.</p>

<p>As Carl Sultzer, a fat boy with a round, ruddy
face, was thrust into the room, he was surrounded
and all present began to chant:</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <span class="i2">Do you want to join this club?</span>
      <span class="i1">If you do, down to the ground,</span>
      <span class="i2">Make to us a bow profound!"</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the chant went on Carl Sultzer was forced to
his knees and was made to bow until his nose
touched the floor.</p>

<p>"Vot is dis ding, annahow?" he asked, in a
trembling voice. "Is dis der Chee Eyes Club, I
ton't know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is the renowned Gee Eyes Club," came in
a solemn tone.</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou join us, base stranger?" asked
another voice.</p>

<p>"Yah, sure, I choin," answered Carl. "Put vot
I got to to alretty?"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt soon see," was the answer. "Numbers
Three and Six, blindfold him."</p>

<p>"Look here, I ton't like dis!" cried the German
student, as a bag was thrown over his head and
fastened around his neck. The bag had a hole in
the back, so that he could get air. But he could
not see a thing.</p>

<p>"It must be done," was the answer. "For particulars
see Section 45, rule 917 of the by-laws.
Are you ready to learn the by-laws?"</p>

<p>"Der py-laws? Vot I got to puy py der py-laws?"
asked the German student, cautiously.</p>

<p>"You haven't got to buy anything. You must
learn them."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," came in
another voice. "A man once&mdash;&mdash;Oh, excuse
me, I forgot!" And the story came to a sudden
end, as the speaker received a whack over the ear
from a stuffed club.</p>

<p>"I believe Shadow would want to tell a story if
he was at a funeral," whispered one hooded figure
to another.</p>

<p>"Lo! the march begins!" cried a loud voice, in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>

Carl Sultzer's ear. It made the German boy
jump. Then he was caught by the arms and his
hands were tied behind him. In this fashion he
was marched from the old boathouse and in the
direction of the new building previously mentioned.</p>

<p>"Vere you been daking me?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Wait, and thou shalt see."</p>

<p>"How I vos going to see of I got mine eyes
blindfolded alretty?"</p>

<p>To this there was no answer, but several of the
hooded figures snickered.</p>

<p>The new building reached, several of the boys
caught up the German lad in a blanket.</p>

<p>"Vot is dis now?" he asked, in fresh alarm.</p>

<p>"Be careful now while you carry him to the
top of the building," whispered one boy, but loud
enough for the German lad to hear.</p>

<p>"Hi! vot is dis, annahow?" yelled Carl.</p>

<p>"A new house they are building. We are going
to take you to the top," answered a member of the
secret society.</p>

<p>"Maype I ton't vos vant to go py der dop alretty,"
pleaded Carl.</p>

<p>"It won't hurt you. Come on, fellows!"</p>

<p>In a twinkling the German youth was lifted up
and carried along, over some wooden horses and
lumber piles. He thought he was going up&mdash;he
knew not where.</p>

<p>"Hi! ton't you trop me town," he wailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Carl dear, we'll drop you up," came in a
cheery voice, and this brought forth another
snicker.</p>

<p>Presently the boys came to a halt, and the victim
was placed on his feet on a narrow board.</p>

<p>"Don't lose your balance," said one boy, cautiously.</p>

<p>"It's about thirty feet to the ground," added
another.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! I ton't vos vant to dumble, ain't it!"
shrieked Carl, in terror.</p>

<p>"You won't if you are careful. Now you must
walk over the beams from one end of this building
to the other."</p>

<p>"I can't vos do dot! I vos dumble town sure!"
wailed Carl.</p>

<p>"You have got to do it if you want to join this
society. Here, let me place your foot on the next
beam," and Carl's right foot was caught up and
put on a beam a foot and a half in front of that
upon which he had been standing.</p>

<p>"Look out! I vos dumble me town!" he
shrieked.</p>

<p>"Steady now and you'll be all right," was the
answer. "Forward you go!"</p>

<p>But poor Carl did not go forward, instead he
remained standing on the two beams, his knees
shaking visibly.</p>

<p>"Forward!" was the cry again, and now he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

tapped on the back with the wooden swords and
stuffed clubs.</p>

<p>"I dumble me town! I dumble me town sure
as I vas porn!" he shrieked. "Ton't douch me!"</p>

<p>"Then move on. We won't let you fall," said
one student, and still trembling the German lad
started to walk across the beams to the other end
of the building, as he thought. He passed over
seven beams when, of a sudden, one fell over.
Down he went, yelling wildly and clutching at the
beam he had just left. Then he struck the ground,
which was just under the beams, and rolled over.
In another moment the sack was taken from his
head and his hands were unloosened.</p>

<p>"Vell, I neffer!" he ejaculated, gazing around in
a sheepish way. "I dink me sure I vos der top
of der puilding on alretty! Und I vos on der
groundt all der vile! Now ain't dot funny!"
And all at once he set up a roar of laughter. The
other students joined in, and the general merriment
lasted for fully five minutes.</p>

<p>"Now, Carl, you are a full-fledged member of
the Gee Eyes," said Dave, coming forward. "Let
me congratulate you." And he gave Carl's hand
a tight squeeze.</p>

<p>"Dank you," said the German lad. Then the
others shook hands, each giving Carl's hand the
tightest squeeze possible. Soon the youth began
to dance around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hi! somepody stop dot!" he roared. "I ton't
vont mine hand squashed to a jelly alretty! Let
go, I told you!" And after that he would do no
more handshaking.</p>

<p>It was rather cold and soon one of the students
suggested that they go back to the Hall. But the
others demurred.</p>

<p>"Let us take a trolley ride," said one. "Just the
thing in this moonlight. We can get back in
plenty of time."</p>

<p>So it was agreed, and off the crowd set, in the
direction of the trolley line, upon which they had
had so much sport the previous summer. Nobody
dreamed of the surprise in store for them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
<span class="small">ALMOST SCARED TO DEATH</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">While</span></span> the Gee Eyes were having their sport
with Carl Sultzer quite another scene was being
enacted some distance away, in the vicinity of the
trolley tracks.</p>

<p>Little Frank Bond, a pale and highly sensitive
youth who had come to Oak Hall two weeks before,
was being initiated into the mysteries of the
D. D. A. Club by Plum, Poole, Jasniff, and several
of their cronies.</p>

<p>Frank did not care for clubs, being a lad of a
retiring disposition. But he had been "talked into
it" by Plum, who thought he saw some keen sport
in scaring the little fellow half to death.</p>

<p>"You must join by all means," said the bully of
the school. "Why, life at Oak Hall won't be
worth living unless you're a member of the D. D.
A. Club." And very foolishly Frank agreed to
submit to an initiation.</p>

<p>"We'll scare him out of his seven senses,"
chuckled Plum. "It will be a barrel of fun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"What will you do?" questioned the others of
the club.</p>

<p>When the bully of Oak Hall unfolded his plan
several demurred, stating it would be rather severe
on a lad of Frank's temperament. But they were
overruled, and in the end the so-styled initiation
was carried out as the bully planned it.</p>

<p>After a good deal of ceremony, which was great
fun and rather enjoyed by the small boy, Frank
was blindfolded and marched out in the direction
of the trolley tracks. The club members took to a
side road, where there was a single track running
to a town several miles distant. On this track was
a new turnout, which had been put down only a
short while before.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Frank, timidly,
as the others hurried him along.</p>

<p>"To the trolley tracks," was the answer. "We
want to test your nerve."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll put you on the tracks and let the
trolley run over you," answered Plum, brutally.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't put me on the tracks!" cried
Frank. "I&mdash;I know you don't want to hurt me,
but a trolley car might come along, and I might get
struck."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," said Jasniff. "If you're
ground up we'll pick up the pieces and give you a
decent burial."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>This sort of talk was kept up until the trolley
line was reached, and the effect was to completely
unnerve the young victim. He was allowed to see
the single track and then blindfolded once more,
and his hands were tied behind his back.</p>

<p>"Now put him on the tracks," commanded
Plum, roughly.</p>

<p>"And don't forget to chain him fast," added
Jasniff, rattling a dog chain he had brought along.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll chain him good and hard," said Nat
Poole.</p>

<p>"No! no! Please don't!" cried Frank, and now
he tried to break away from his tormentors. A
struggle ensued, but in the end he was subdued and
dragged along the track to where was located the
turnout just mentioned. Here he was thrown on
his back, and his hands were fastened down to one
of the rails.</p>

<p>"Don't! Let me go! Please let me go!" he
shrieked. "I don't want to be tied to the track!
I don't want to join the club! If a trolley should
come along I'd surely be hurt! Let me go!"
And he started to struggle again.</p>

<p>"See here, aren't we going a little too far?"
whispered one of the students.</p>

<p>"He's too sensitive for this sort of sport," added
another.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! it's all right," interrupted Plum.
"The little beggar won't be hurt in the least."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he'll be scared to death."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the fun of it," came from Jasniff.</p>

<p>In the meantime Frank Bond continued to cry
out to be released. He was so frightened now
that he know not what to do. He struggled madly
to break his bonds.</p>

<p>"I'm going to let him go," began one boy, a lad
named Messmer.</p>

<p>"Don't you touch him," answered Plum,
roughly. "It's only fun."</p>

<p>"But, Gus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here comes the trolley!" shouted Jasniff.
"Now, Bond, take it easy when they run over
you!"</p>

<p>"Don't throw the trolley off the track," added
Plum, brutally.</p>

<p>The trolley came along swiftly in the semi-darkness,
and as it approached Frank Bond let out a
piercing scream for help. He was now completely
beside himself with fear.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't! Help!" he screamed. "Save
me! Save me!" And then he began to foam at
the mouth.</p>

<p>With a rush and a roar the trolley car came on.
The poor boy on the turnout track thought sure
it was going to run over him and struggled madly
to get free. Then, just as the trolley swept beside
him, he broke his bonds, leaped to his feet, and
stepped blindly toward the car. His arm struck

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

the back platform and he was hurled backward.
Then the trolley, with its gleaming headlight,
swept on its way, the motorman taking no notice
of what had happened.</p>

<p>"He's hurt!" was the cry from Messmer.</p>

<p>"It's the little beggar's own fault," said Gus
Plum, but his voice trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am killed! I am killed!" cried Frank,
struggling to his feet and throwing the bandage
from his eyes. He was foaming at the mouth, and
bleeding both at the head and on the hand.
"Don't let the trolley go over me again! Save
me! Save me!" And then, with a bound, he
turned and disappeared into the bushes and trees
which lined the trolley road at this point.</p>

<p>"He has gone mad!" whispered one of the boys,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"As mad as a March hare," was the comment of
another of the students. "Come back, Frank!
It's all right!" he called out.</p>

<p>"The little fool!" muttered Jasniff. "He
wouldn't have been hurt at all if he had remained
quiet." He raised his voice: "Come back here,
Bond, it's all over!"</p>

<p>"I said he couldn't stand it," said Messmer.
"It was a shame to go so far."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't preach to me," returned Jasniff.
"Bond, are you coming back?" he cried, in a louder
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The only reply was a distant scream, so cold and
uncanny it made all of the students shiver. Then
came other screams, gradually growing fainter and
fainter.</p>

<p>"He is going deeper and deeper into the
woods!"</p>

<p>"Say, we'll have to get him out of that!"</p>

<p>"He has gone crazy, just as sure as fate," said
Messmer. "Come, we must bring him back and
do what we can for him."</p>

<p>The wood was a long one and some distance
from the trolley turnout was another road, leading
down to the main line. Dave and his chums were
coming along this road when Ben came to a sudden
halt.</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>"What did you hear, Ben?"</p>

<p>Before Ben could answer Dave's question a
blood-curdling scream rent the air. It was followed
by another and then another.</p>

<p>"My gracious! is that a ghost?" queried Sam
Day.</p>

<p>"It's somebody in trouble perhaps," came from
Roger.</p>

<p>"Of dot peen a ghost I dink I go me pack to der
Hall alretty now!" said Carl Sultzer, in alarm.</p>

<p>"There are no ghosts," said Dave. "All so-called
ghosts are make-believes&mdash;humbugs, in
fact."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," said
Shadow, as the crowd came to a halt, listening to a
repetition of the cries. "A lot of college students
wanted to play a joke on their professor, so they
put together the body of one bug, the wings of
another, the legs of another, and the horns of another.
Then they went to the old professor and
said: 'Here is a wonderful new bug we have found.
What family does it belong to?' The old professor
looked the thing over for a minute. 'A
well-known family,' he said. 'A very large
family.' 'What?' asked the students, all ready to
laugh at the old fellow. 'The family of humbugs,'
answered the professor."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Roger, laughing, while
the others joined in.</p>

<p>"Say, vot has dot hum-pug to to mit dot ghost?"
asked Carl, innocently. He had been the only one
unable to appreciate the joke.</p>

<p>"Nothing, but&mdash;listen!"</p>

<p>Buster Beggs broke off short, as another scream
rent the air. Then the members of the Gee Eyes
saw a wild-looking youth rush across the road and
disappear among the trees beyond.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?"</p>

<p>"It was a boy!"</p>

<p>"He acted as if he was crazy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and do you know who it was?" demanded
Dave. "It was little Frank Bond!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it was," added Roger. "Boys, what can
this mean?"</p>

<p>"He must be in trouble," said Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some wild animal scared him," was
Ben's comment. "But what can he be doing out
here alone this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Bond! Bond!" cried Roger. "Come back
here! What's the matter?"</p>

<p>But the only answer that came back was another
scream, as the half-crazed lad plunged deeper and
deeper into the wood. Soon he was completely
out of hearing.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," was Dave's comment.</p>

<p>"Listen, I hear somebody else coming," said
Ben, and soon they heard Plum and his crowd approaching
through the woods. They were hunting
in several directions for Frank Bond.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" cried Roger to the other crowd, and
soon the D. D. A. members and the Gee Eyes confronted
each other.</p>

<p>"What brings you out here?" demanded Plum,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"We might ask the same question of you?" returned
Dave, coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Porter, have you seen anything of
little Frank Bond?" asked Messmer, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"Yes, we saw him a minute ago. He ran across
this road as if he was crazy. What's the trouble?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't say a word!" burst out Jasniff, confronting
his fellow club member.</p>

<p>"Bond got scared and ran away from us," went
on Messmer, ignoring Nick Jasniff completely.
"Did he&mdash;er&mdash;did he look hurt, or&mdash;er&mdash;crazy?"</p>

<p>"He looked both," put in Roger. "What have
you been doing, hazing him?"</p>

<p>"That's our affair," broke in Plum, warningly.</p>

<p>"Look here, Plum, and you too, Jasniff, I won't
stand for any more of your talk!" cried Messmer,
wrathfully. "You went too far, and I said so from
the start." He turned again to Dave and Roger.
"We were initiating Bond into our club. We had
him down to the trolley track and&mdash;well, he got
badly scared and bumped into a trolley that was
passing. Then all at once he seemed to go crazy
and ran off into the woods. We don't know
how badly he is hurt or where he has gone to."</p>

<p>"If that's the case, one thing is certain," said
Dave. "We must find him, and do it as soon as
possible."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
<span class="small">A STUDENT'S STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Much</span></span> against the wishes of Plum, Poole, and
Jasniff, Messmer told many of the details of what
had been done to poor Frank Bond. He did not
attempt to shield himself. His story was corroborated
by a student named Jardell, who was disgusted
by the attitude taken by the bully of Oak
Hall and his intimates.</p>

<p>"I like fun as well as the next one," said Jardell,
"but I don't want to see it carried too far."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't blame us for everything,"
sneered Plum. "You're tarred with the same
brush."</p>

<p>"There is no use in discussing the matter now,"
said Dave. "What we want to do is to find poor
Frank. Why, he may be seriously hurt!"</p>

<p>"I trust not," answered Messmer, turning pale.</p>

<p>The students walked into the wood and a search
was begun that lasted the best part of an hour.
Nobody got on the trail of the missing boy and no
more cries were heard. It was so dark that but
little could be seen, and at last the whole crowd
came out on the road again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The thoughts of a trolley ride had been abandoned
by the members of the Gee Eyes, and they
decided to get back to the Hall as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"But Dr. Clay ought to be told about Frank,"
said Dave, to Messmer and Jardell.</p>

<p>"I'll tell him," answered Messmer, promptly.
"I'll tell him the truth, even if I'm dismissed from
the school for it."</p>

<p>"So will I," added Jardell.</p>

<p>"Going to get us into trouble, eh?" growled Gus
Plum. "Better go slow."</p>

<p>"I'll not mention any names," said Messmer.</p>

<p>"Neither will I," added Jardell. "I am not
that kind."</p>

<p>Presently all of the students returned to Oak
Hall by the shortest possible route. The Gee
Eyes went in a crowd by themselves, and because
of an open back door had small difficulty in entering
without being noticed. A little later Plum and
his cronies came in, followed by Messmer and Jardell.</p>

<p>"Do you think Messmer and Jardell will really
go to the doctor?" questioned Sam Day.</p>

<p>"I do," answered Dave. "They are good, honest
fellows, both of them. After this I reckon
they'll give Plum and his crowd the go-by." And
in that surmise Dave was correct.</p>

<p>The boys listened in the upper hallway, and soon

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

heard Messmer and Jardell enter the Hall. The
two held a whispered talk for a minute and then
walked boldly to Dr. Clay's room and rapped on
the door.</p>

<p>"They are certainly going to face the music,"
whispered Roger.</p>

<p>"I admire their grit," was Ben's comment.</p>

<p>The knock on the doctor's door was answered by
a voice from within, and presently Dr. Clay appeared,
clad in his dressing-gown. Then the
owner of the Hall and the two students went down
to the office.</p>

<p>Exactly all that passed between the doctor and
Messmer and Jardell was never known to the
school at large. But it was known that the boys
told a straight story and utterly refused to mention
any names but their own and poor Frank Bond's.
As soon as the meeting in the office was over Dr.
Clay summoned Jackson Lemond and Swingly the
janitor, and all three went out, taking Messmer
and Jardell with them.</p>

<p>"They have gone on a hunt," said Dave. "Oh,
I do hope they find that poor lad!"</p>

<p>It goes without saying that some of the students
did not sleep well that night. Plum, Poole, and
Jasniff were particularly restless, fearing they
would be called to the bar of justice. They were
sure Messmer and Jardell would "blab" on them,
as the bully expressed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if they do, I'll hammer the life out of
them," said the bully.</p>

<p>"And so will I," added Jasniff.</p>

<p>In the morning it was easy to see that something
was wrong. The teachers and hired help went
around whispering to themselves, and there was a
good deal of quiet talking among the boys. It
was soon learned that Frank Bond was still missing
and nobody knew what had become of him.</p>

<p>As soon as the school was assembled Dr. Clay
addressed the students.</p>

<p>"Young gentlemen, a most deplorable thing occurred
last night," he began. "One of the younger
students was taken out and 'initiated,' as it is called,
into one of your secret societies. The strain was
too great on his nerves, and after being hurt by a
trolley car, he became half-crazy and disappeared
into the North End woods. Two students have
already told me about the affair. I want to know
the names of the others connected with this occurrence.
Anybody who had anything to do with it,
stand up."</p>

<p>There was a full minute of silence and the students
looked keenly at one another.</p>

<p>"Does anybody in this assembly room know anything
about this at all?" went on the master of Oak
Hall. "Remember, young gentlemen, it is a
serious matter, and I want to learn all there is to
know of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>As the doctor ceased speaking Dave arose in his
seat. He was promptly followed by Roger, Ben,
and half a dozen others of the Gee Eyes. The
other students looked at those who had arisen in
astonishment, while Plum, Poole, and Jasniff were
dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Is he going to blab too?" whispered Jasniff to
Plum, indicating Dave.</p>

<p>"Looks like it."</p>

<p>"Porter, what have you to say?" questioned Dr.
Clay.</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, sir, but I am willing to tell
what I can. I had nothing to do with the hazing,
or whatever you may call it. But I was out near
the woods last night and I saw Frank Bond run
across the road and plunge into the woods at the
North End. A whole crowd of us searched for
him, but we could not find him."</p>

<p>"And what have you to say, Morr?"</p>

<p>"I was with Dave Porter, sir," answered the
senator's son.</p>

<p>"So was I," "And I," came from the others of
the Gee Eyes.</p>

<p>"You had nothing to do with Frank Bond
previous to his becoming frightened and running
away?" demanded the master of the Hall, sharply.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I was not near him, nor were any of
my companions," answered Dave, indicating his
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you were not with Messmer and Jardell?"</p>

<p>"Not until after we met on the road and started
to hunt for Bond, sir."</p>

<p>"We were with an entirely different party, Dr.
Clay," said Messmer, rising in his seat.</p>

<p>"The party that 'initiated' Bond, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Are those students in this room?"</p>

<p>Messmer remained silent.</p>

<p>"Messmer, answer me."</p>

<p>"Dr. Clay, they are in this room, but I&mdash;I cannot
tell you who they are."</p>

<p>"Porter, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of breathless silence.</p>

<p>"Dr. Clay, I would rather you would not ask me
to mention any names," said Dave, slowly but
firmly. "I think every fellow ought to speak up
for himself. He will if he has any honor about
him."</p>

<p>"Then you decline to speak?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to say that I do, sir."</p>

<p>There was another pause, and then a rather
stupid boy arose and began to shuffle his feet uneasily.</p>

<p>"What is it, Seabold?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"I ain't going to hang back no longer, Dr.
Clay," stammered Seabold. "I was in that&mdash;er&mdash;that
mix-up with Messmer and Jardell. Porter

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>

and Morr and that crowd didn't have anything to
do with it. I don't like to be a sneak, but I can't
stand up for such a sneak as Gus Plum, nor Nat
Poole, nor Nick Jasniff neither. We were all in it
together, and as Porter says, they ought to have
honor enough to speak up and take their share of
the blame. We didn't mean to hurt Frank Bond,
only to scare him. When he ran away I got scared
myself and so did the others. We began to hunt
for Frank, and then Porter and his crowd came
along and helped us. But it was no use, we
couldn't find the boy. I ain't slept all night thinking
of Frank. I'd give all I'm worth to find him."</p>

<p>"Who got up the plan to tie Bond to the trolley
track?"</p>

<p>"Gus Plum spoke of it first."</p>

<p>"It ain't so!" yelled Gus Plum, leaping up, his
face very red. "I didn't have anything more to
do with it than anybody else."</p>

<p>"He spoke of it to me," added Seabold.</p>

<p>"Poole, what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn't have hardly anything to do
with it," said Nat, lamely, his knees shaking beneath
him. "I&mdash;er&mdash;looked on&mdash;mostly."</p>

<p>"Jasniff, did you propose the plan?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Jasniff, boldly. "I reckon
Messmer and Jardell and Seabold hatched it up
between them."</p>

<p>"So they did," put in Plum, maliciously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is positively false," declared Messmer.
"As a matter of fact I said I didn't want to go so
far, because Frank seemed to be so frightened. If
I had had my own way I should have released him
long before the trolley car came along. He was
too nervous to stand such fun."</p>

<p>"If the truth is to come out, Gus Plum is the one
who proposed tying Bond to the trolley track,"
said Jardell. "I wasn't going to say a word, but
I am not going to stand here and let him throw the
blame on Messmer and me, or on Porter and his
crowd, or anybody else. I have told the exact
truth so far as I am concerned, and I am ready to
take any punishment that is coming to me."</p>

<p>After this a long talk followed, and in the end
the master of the Hall said he would take up the
matter later, when it was learned what had become
of Frank Bond. In the meantime, so great was
the excitement, the school was dismissed for the
day, and those who wished to do so were told that
they might go out until sundown in a search for the
missing pupil.</p>

<p>"I am certainly going out," said Dave, to Roger
and Ben. "I think we ought to do our best to find
him, or else find out about him."</p>

<p>"Maybe he jumped into the river and drowned
himself," suggested Ben.</p>

<p>"Or fell over some cliff and got killed," added
the senator's son. "A fellow so scared as he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

might do almost anything. But I agree with
Dave, we ought to go out."</p>

<p>The matter was talked over, and in the end
Dave, Ben, Roger, and Beggs set off in a little
party, taking a lunch with them. In the meantime
others went out too, so that the woods known as
the North End were alive with boys and men, all
searching for the missing student.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">The</span></span> four students remembered the part of the
big woods which had been gone over before and
consequently they did not attempt to search for
Frank Bond in that direction. They struck out
over a small hill and then along somewhat of a
hollow, though which ran a small creek that flowed
into the Leming River.</p>

<p>The way was rough and uncertain, and several
times they had fairly to force their progress
through the bushes. Once Buster Beggs got
caught so thoroughly that the others had to turn
back to aid him.</p>

<p>"Do you think Frank could have come in this
direction?" questioned Roger. "How could he
get through?"</p>

<p>"A fellow who is half crazy will do all sorts of
queer things," answered Dave. "And as we
couldn't find him in the other part of the woods, it
appears to me as if he must have come this way."</p>

<p>Over an hour was spent in searching along the
creek, but without avail. They called Frank's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>

name a great number of times, but not a sound
came back save the call of the birds.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't like to run across any snakes," said
Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any very bad snakes
in this woods," answered Ben.</p>

<p>They now made another turn and came up to
the face of a rocky cliff. Suddenly Dave leaped
forward.</p>

<p>"Look! look!" he cried, and held up a handkerchief
covered with blood. In one corner were the
initials, F. A. B.</p>

<p>"Frank A. Bond," said Roger. "We must be
on the right track."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only we don't find the poor fellow
dead!" murmured Dave.</p>

<p>Further on the rocks were very rough, and then
came a cleft leading into a small cavern. The
entrance was dark and partly covered with brush.</p>

<p>"See, the bushes are torn and broken," was Ben's
comment. "Somebody has been walking in and
out."</p>

<p>They gazed into the cavern, but for a few seconds
could see nothing.</p>

<p>"Frank!" called out Dave. "Frank Bond!"</p>

<p>"Help!" came back, in a faint voice. "Help
me!"</p>

<p>"He is here!" exclaimed Dave. "Has anybody
a match so we can make a light?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Buster Briggs had some matches, which he used
for his bicycle lamp, and with one of these the four
boys set fire to some dry brushwood they pulled up.
The glare from the flames lit up the interior of the
cavern, and they gazed inside, to behold poor
Frank Bond lying in a corner on some leaves. The
young student was utterly exhausted and lay with
his eyes closed.</p>

<p>"Frank, are you hurt?" asked Dave, bending
over him. "I mean, are you hurt very
badly?"</p>

<p>At the sound of Dave's voice the youth on the
leaves opened his eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>"Take me back to school!" he gasped. "Don't&mdash;don't
let the trolley run over me!"</p>

<p>"Frank, you are safe now&mdash;nothing is going to
hurt you," said the senator's son. "Tell us where
you are hurt."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" Frank Bond stared around him.
"I thought it was the Plum crowd after me!
Whe&mdash;where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"From the school. We came out to look for
you."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"What about your hurts?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, I got my arm hurt, and my leg, and I fell
down and cut my face," answered the sufferer.
"I&mdash;I don't know how I got here, and I didn't
know the way home, and I got hungry and sleepy,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" Frank Bond could not go on,
but burst into tears.</p>

<p>"We'll fix you up," said Dave, kindly. "We've
brought some lunch with us and you shall have all
you want. Start up that fire briskly, fellows."</p>

<p>The fire was built up in good shape, and two
torches were brought into the cavern. Then
Frank Bond was propped up against a wall and
given something to eat and to drink. He was very
hungry and ate up fully half of what the four boys
carried. Water was then brought in from the
creek and his several wounds were washed and
dressed. Fortunately none of them was serious,
although they had been very painful.</p>

<p>The small student was still in a highly nervous
state and the others did all they could to quiet him.
He remembered being tied to the trolley track and
running away, but could not tell how he had
reached the cavern or how long he had remained
there.</p>

<p>"I guess I was plumb crazy," he declared. "I
thought sure the trolley car was going to run over
me!"</p>

<p>At last the others managed to get him to his
feet. But he was too weak to walk more than a
few steps at a time.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't do it," he gasped. "Oh, how will
I ever get back to the Hall?"</p>

<p>"Let us take turns at carrying him," suggested

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

Dave. "Frank, you can hold on to my back, can't
you?"</p>

<p>The small student said he would try, and putting
out the fire the whole party quitted the cavern, the
hurt lad on Dave's back. It was quite a load for
Dave to master, but he managed it for several
hundred yards, when each of the others took a turn.
Thus, after hard work, they got Frank to the roadway.</p>

<p>A loud yelling brought some other boys and
Andrew Dale to the scene. One of the boys had
his wheel and, riding on this, he went back to the
academy and had Jackson Lemond come for Frank
with a carriage. Then a pistol was fired off three
times,&mdash;this being the signal showing that the missing
one was found. Soon pupils and teachers came
trooping back to Oak Hall, all anxious to listen to
Frank's story.</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived at the Hall, the small
student was taken to a private bedroom and a doctor
was sent for to attend him. In the meantime
he was given something hot to drink and rolled in
blankets, that he might not take cold. Not until
that evening did Dr. Clay attempt to get the details
of his story from the sufferer.</p>

<p>When the physician arrived he said that Frank's
hurts were not of a serious nature. "He has been
more frightened than anything else," said the doctor.
"He must be kept very quiet for at least a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

week, and after that, Dr. Clay, you had better let
him go slowly with his studies for a month or
so."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," answered the master of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"This lad is of a high-strung temperament and
he has been under an unusual mental strain."</p>

<p>"You do not think he will suffer permanently?"
asked the good doctor, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, but he must be kept quiet."</p>

<p>In an easy kind of way Dr. Clay drew from
Frank Bond his whole story of the initiation into
the D. D. A. Club. From the lad he learned that
Plum and Jasniff had been the prime movers in
the so-called fun, and that Poole had backed them
up. He at once sent for the three to come to his
private office.</p>

<p>"I reckon we're in for it now," growled Plum,
on receiving the summons.</p>

<p>"Deny everything," advised Nick Jasniff. He
thought nothing of telling a falsehood whenever it
suited him.</p>

<p>When the three entered the office Dr. Clay faced
them sternly.</p>

<p>"I want to have a talk to you three young gentlemen,"
said the master of Oak Hall. "I have
learned the truth of the Frank Bond affair and I
want to know what you mean by such conduct."</p>

<p>The three tried to excuse themselves, but it was
to no purpose. The doctor read them through

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

and through, and then gave each a lecture that was
never forgotten.</p>

<p>"Fun is fun, but this was not fun," said he.
"Bond is a delicate and highly nervous boy, and to
do what you did was to make him suffer most horribly.
It is a wonder that you did not drive him
insane. As it is, he will suffer for a long time to
come, and if his parents see fit to prosecute you it
will be your own fault if you are sent to jail.
More than that, you have disgraced this school,
and for that I intend to punish you myself. Each
of you must remain inside of the academy grounds
for the next two weeks, and in addition I will give
you some extra lessons in history to learn, and I
want them learned thoroughly. And more than
this, if you are ever concerned in such a disgraceful
proceeding again I shall dismiss you from Oak
Hall."</p>

<p>When the three students left the doctor's office
Nat Poole was so cowed that he trembled in every
limb. Plum, too, was subdued, but Jasniff was
boiling with inward rage.</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to be bulldozed," he declared.
"If I want some fun I am going to have
it. If old Clay sends me away, I guess I'll find
some other school just as good." Jasniff was certainly
a bad youth, but the others were still to find
out how really bad he was.</p>

<p>After this a week slipped by rather quickly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>

During that time Dave got word from the Lawrences
that Phil was a trifle better physically, but
that his head hurt him a great deal. He was still
in bed and there was no telling when he would get
around again.</p>

<p>"I trust it doesn't hurt his head permanently,"
said Dave, for at least the fiftieth time. He had
heard of a boy who had had his head hurt
by a water-wheel and had become silly in consequence.</p>

<p>"Let us hope for the best," answered Roger.
"Poor Phil! It would certainly be awful if he
didn't get around all right again!"</p>

<p>The injuries received by Phil and Frank Bond
put something of a damper on the school and for
some time matters ran along very quietly. Plum
was troubled in more ways than one. He was
afraid he was going to hear from Frank Bond's
father or the police, and he was also worrying over
his football wagers. He had lost all his spending
money and he owed about thirty dollars, and his
friends were pressing him to pay up. He had
gone to Poole for a loan, but Nat had all he could
do to pay his own losses. Jasniff had promised to
do something, but since the Bond affair had said
nothing more on the subject.</p>

<p>"Say, Nick, I thought you were going to help
me get some money," said he one day to his crony,
when he could keep silent no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"Haven't you got some money from home?"
asked the other boy, with a leer.</p>

<p>"No, my dad can't spare any just now," answered
the bully, bluntly. He was growing
desperate. His father had written that he must
get along without spending money for at least a
month more.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll let you know what I can do in a week
or so," answered Jasniff, slowly.</p>

<p>"You said that before&mdash;right after the football
game."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't been able to see those fellows
yet."</p>

<p>"What fellows?"</p>

<p>"Those I want to talk to."</p>

<p>"Can't you hurry it up, Nick? I want some
money the worst way&mdash;ten or fifteen dollars at
least."</p>

<p>The two were alone, down at the old boathouse,
and Jasniff was smoking a cigarette on the sly.
He blew a cloud of smoke to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Wonder if I can trust you to keep mum?" he
said, slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About a little plan I've got to make some
money."</p>

<p>"Haven't you always been able to trust me,
Nick?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but&mdash;this is out of the ordinary."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never went back on you yet."</p>

<p>"Will you promise to keep silent if I tell you
something?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I've got a scheme to get hold of several hundred
dollars."</p>

<p>"That's good."</p>

<p>"It will take some&mdash;er&mdash;quiet work on the part
of both of us to do the trick."</p>

<p>"Well, as I said before, I am with you."</p>

<p>"Can I trust you absolutely?" demanded Jasniff,
looking Plum closely in the face.</p>

<p>"You can."</p>

<p>"Then take a walk and we'll talk the matter
over. But remember, if you say a word to anybody
about it&mdash;well, you had better not, that's
all!"</p>

<p>They walked to a secluded spot and there, slowly
and cautiously, Nick Jasniff unfolded a plot to get
money which filled Gus Plum with curiosity, fear,
wonder, and fascination.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">A BOY AND A MOTOR CYCLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">With</span></span> all the excitement Dave had not forgotten
his studies and each day he spent all the
time that was necessary in preparing his lessons.
He had a faculty of concentrating his mind upon
what he was doing and this made learning easy.</p>

<p>"Going in for the medal of honor, I suppose,"
said Roger one day, as he observed Dave grinding
away at a Latin exercise. "Well, if you win it I
guess you'll deserve it."</p>

<p>"I am going to do what I can, Roger. I didn't
come to Oak Hall just to cut up."</p>

<p>The medal of honor had been promised by Dr.
Clay to the pupil who should stand highest in lessons
and deportment at the end of the term. It
was a beautiful medal of solid gold, and many
students secretly hoped to win it. So far Polly
Vane was in the lead, with Dave, Buster Beggs,
Sam Day, Roger, and a student named Langdale
close behind.</p>

<p>"Langdale says he is going to win or die in the
attempt," went on the senator's son. "He is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

studying day and night, and so far his deportment
has been about perfect."</p>

<p>"Well, mine hasn't been&mdash;at least, not according
to Job Haskers," answered Dave. "He marks
me down whenever he can."</p>

<p>"He does that to all of us," said Sam Day, who
was near. "I wish he'd mark us up once."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," came from
Shadow Hamilton, who was resting on the end of a
bed. "A clothing dealer was going to have a fire
sale. So he lit some damp paper in his stove and
turned off the draught, so that his stock got all
smoked up. Then he called his son Moses up.
'Make out new brice tickets,' says he to Moses.
'All right, fader,' says Moses, and goes to work,
and the next day he put out suits of clothing labeled
like this: 'Great Fire Sale! Suits marked down
from $9.00 to $7.98.' Soon a man came along to
buy a suit. 'Why,' says he, 'that suit was only
$5.50 two days ago.' 'Yes,' says Moses. 'Vos
it? Vell, ve haf der fire since, and now der suits
vos all moth-broof!'"</p>

<p>"Phew! that's enough to drive all the lessons
from a fellow's head!" cried Dave, after a short
laugh. "Where did you get it, Shadow?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he picked it out of the Old Farmers'
Almanack," said Buster Beggs.</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind," began Shadow
calmly. "A boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not to-day!" interrupted Roger. "That's the
fiftieth you've told this week. I'm going out for
a spin, boys."</p>

<p>"Going to try that new motor cycle?" queried
Dave, looking up.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let it run away with you," and
Dave smiled broadly.</p>

<p>"No fear," said Roger, with a laugh, and left
the dormitory.</p>

<p>The senator's son had received a new motor
cycle the day before. It was a beautiful nickel-plated
affair and Roger was very proud of it. He
knew a little about motor cycles, so it did not take
him long to get the machine in trim for use. He
took a spin up and down the road, and let Dave and
some others try it, and all pronounced it a beauty.</p>

<p>Roger was soon on the motor cycle and speeding
in the direction of Oakdale. In the town he made
a few small purchases, and then came away for a
spin in the direction of Rockville, taking a side
road which he thought in better condition than the
main road.</p>

<p>The senator's son had covered a mile when he
saw two boys on bicycles approaching him. He
reduced his speed, and as the pair came closer he
recognized Plum and Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Got your motor out, eh?" said the bully of Oak
Hall, rather sourly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," returned Roger, briefly.</p>

<p>"Can you get it to work?"</p>

<p>"The machine works perfectly."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have my bicycle," sneered Jasniff.
"That thing makes too much noise for me."</p>

<p>"So would I," added Gus Plum. "Too much
noise and too much smell."</p>

<p>"I'd rather have the motor cycle, so there you
are," answered the senator's son, and moved on
again, while the others did the same. "I guess it's
a case of sour grapes," he told himself.</p>

<p>Roger had just passed a bend of the road when
something happened to the battery which supplied
the electric spark to ignite the gasoline. He set
the motor cycle against a rock, and it was a full
quarter of an hour before he could make the battery
work. During that time somebody came
through the bushes near him and looked at the
youth, but Roger took no notice.</p>

<p>The motor cycle ready for use once more, the
senator's son hopped on the saddle and turned on
the power. All seemed to go well and presently,
to make up for lost time, he put on all speed.</p>

<p>"It won't do to be late for supper," he reasoned.
"Haskers will catch me sure."</p>

<p>He passed another turn, between some high
bushes. The way was now downhill, leading over
a small stream flowing into the Leming River.
The motor cycle took the down-grade at a rapid

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>

rate of speed, and fearing an accident, Roger attempted
to turn off the power and put on the brake.</p>

<p>To his horror he could not move the power
lever, which had become caught in some manner.
The motor cycle was now bounding down the road
at a terrific rate of speed. Just ahead was the little
bridge. Roger gave a vain tug or two. Then
the machine struck the rough boards of the bridge,
made a turn against the stone wall, and heels over
head the senator's son went sailing over the stone
wall to the rocks and water below!</p>

<p>It was a terrible fall, much worse than that experienced
by Dave and Babcock when they had run
into the fallen tree, and no sooner did Roger land
than his senses forsook him. His legs and part of
his body went into the water, while his head and
arms rested on some sand.</p>

<p>The short autumn day drew to a close and Roger
did not appear at Oak Hall. The other students
went to supper and then for the first Dave learned
that the senator's son had not gotten back.</p>

<p>"Where is Master Morr?" demanded Job Haskers,
severely.</p>

<p>"He went out on his new motor cycle," answered
Dave. "Perhaps he had a breakdown."</p>

<p>"If he was not sure he could get back in time
he should not have gone out," snapped the disagreeable
teacher.</p>

<p>Supper over, some of the students retired to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

their dormitories while others sought the library
and the gymnasium. Dave and Ben looked around
for Roger, but as he did not put in an appearance
they obtained permission from Andrew Dale to go
out on their bicycles and make a hunt for the missing
one.</p>

<p>"He must be somewhere in this vicinity," said
Dave.</p>

<p>"He said he was going to Oakdale and would
then come back by the Cass Brook road," returned
Ben.</p>

<p>"Let us take to the Cass Brook road then, Ben.
Maybe we'll meet him."</p>

<p>With their bicycle lamps lit and turned up
brightly, the pair set off, and were soon out of sight
of Oak Hall. The road was smooth and they
made rapid progress. Ben took to one side of the
road while Dave pursued the other. All was dark
and quiet, not a breath of air stirring the almost
leafless trees.</p>

<p>A mile covered, they slowed down, to peer into
the bushes beside the road. They were now
within half a mile of the bridge where Roger had
taken the tumble.</p>

<p>"Hello! here comes somebody!" cried Dave,
presently, and looked ahead. The rays of the
bicycle lamp fell on a figure covered with dirt and
dripping wet. "I declare, it's Roger!"</p>

<p>Dave had scarcely uttered the words when the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>

figure tottered and fell. Riding up, the two boys
dismounted and rushed forward. Roger lay in
the middle of the road, his face resting on one arm.</p>

<p>"Roger what is it?" asked Dave. "Are you
badly hurt?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I took a header&mdash;over the bridge!" gasped
the senator's son, when he could speak. "I&mdash;fell
in th&mdash;the water!" His teeth began to chatter.
"My, but it was co&mdash;co&mdash;cold!"</p>

<p>"Any bones broken?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I reckon no&mdash;not. But I am awfully we&mdash;weak!"</p>

<p>"Where is the motor cycle?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do&mdash;don't know."</p>

<p>"Here, put on my sweater," said Dave, and hastened
to take off that which was wet. "We must
get him to the Hall somehow," he added.</p>

<p>"If he isn't hurt he had better walk," returned
Ben. "It will help to get his blood in circulation."</p>

<p>"Maybe I can walk if you'll help me," answered
Roger.</p>

<p>The two bicycles were hidden in the bushes and
Dave got on one side of the senator's son and Ben
on the other. Thus supported, the sufferer started
again for Oak Hall. He was hurried along as
fast as possible, and arrived there feeling somewhat
warmer than when discovered by Dave and
Ben. Under Dr. Clay's directions he was put to
bed and given some hot tea to drink. Only his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>

left hand was bruised and this was washed and
plastered up.</p>

<p>Having gotten Roger to Oak Hall, Dave and
Ben received permission to go back to the brook
road for their wheels. They found the bicycles
where they had left them, and then went on a hunt
for Roger's motor cycle.</p>

<p>"It certainly ought to be at the bridge," said
Ben.</p>

<p>"If it didn't blow up," answered Dave, "or run
off of its own accord. Roger said he couldn't shut
off the power."</p>

<p>"If it ran off alone I don't think it would go very
far, Dave."</p>

<p>The bridge reached, they looked around in all
directions but could see nothing of the motor cycle.
They went down to where Roger had landed and
saw the impression of his body and feet in the wet
sand.</p>

<p>"He can thank his stars that he didn't break his
neck," said Dave. "This beats the fall Paul and
I took."</p>

<p>"It's queer you never got to the bottom of that
accident, Dave."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will, some day. I am certain that
tree didn't fall of itself."</p>

<p>Having spent fully a quarter of an hour in looking
for the motor cycle without success, there
seemed to be nothing to do but to return to Oak

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>

Hall. This they did, and stored their wheels in
the room set apart at the gymnasium for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Didn't find the motor cycle, eh?" said Sam
Day, who was practising on the rings. "That is
certainly queer."</p>

<p>"Maybe the motor cycle was stolen," suggested
Shadow.</p>

<p>"Who would steal such a machine?" asked Ben.
"Very few know how to run them."</p>

<p>"They might have taken it away in a wagon.
Some people are mean enough to steal anything
they lay hands on."</p>

<p>Dave and Ben spent some time in cleaning their
bicycles and in oiling them. Then they left the
gymnasium in company with Sam Day and several
others. As they approached the Hall, Macklin
came running out.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the news?" cried the younger
student.</p>

<p>"News?" queried Dave. "What news?"</p>

<p>"About Roger Morr?"</p>

<p>"We know he had a bad tumble, and we know
we can't find his motor cycle," said Ben.</p>

<p>"Oh, so the machine is gone too," went on Chip
Macklin. "Well, that certainly beats all!"</p>

<p>"What beats all?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"This whole affair about Roger. When they
put him to bed they didn't give his clothing much

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>

attention. Now they have just found out that he
either lost everything he had or else he was
robbed."</p>

<p>"Lost? Robbed?" cried Dave. "Are you
sure of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You can go up yourself if you wish."</p>

<p>"I will," said Dave, and ran up to the dormitory.
Several boys were present and also Dr. Clay
and Andrew Dale.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable and must be investigated,"
Dr. Clay was saying. "Ah, here is Master Porter
now. Did you find the motor cycle?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, it wasn't in sight anywhere. Ben and
I looked high and low for it."</p>

<p>"Then that must have been stolen too," said
Andrew Dale.</p>

<p>"They tell me Roger was robbed," said Ben.
"What did he lose?"</p>

<p>"Lost a whole lot of things," replied Roger
himself. "My watch and my diamond stickpin,
and a gold ring, some loose change, and forty dollars
that father sent me for some new books I've
been ordering! Somebody cleaned me out for
fair!" And the senator's son spoke very disconsolately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">The</span></span> news that Roger had been robbed while
unconscious spread rapidly, and many were the
speculations as to who had done the wicked deed.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was somebody who just happened
to come along," said Dave. "But what a mean
thing to do! That person did not know but that
Roger was dying, and made no effort to assist
him!"</p>

<p>Roger's story was a brief one. How long he
had remained unconscious he did not know. He
came to his senses with a shiver, to find himself
lying on some rocks under one end of the stone
bridge. The lower portion of his body was wet
and the chill had aided in reviving him. When he
felt strong enough he had crawled up to the road
and looked for his motor cycle. Not finding the
machine, he had started for Oak Hall on foot.
He felt himself growing weaker every step and fell
prostrate, as already described, just as Dave and
Ben discovered him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am awfully glad you came along," said the
senator's son to his two chums. "I don't know
what I should have done if you hadn't."</p>

<p>"And you didn't know a thing about being
robbed, then?" queried Ben.</p>

<p>"No, all I knew was that I was cold and as weak
as a sick cat," was the answer.</p>

<p>A hunt was made for the robber, and the students
spent several hours in searching around the
spot. Nothing was found, and the local authorities
were notified.</p>

<p>This robbery, coupled with those that had gone
before, aroused the whole community. Many felt
that they were no longer safe in their homes, and a
meeting was held in Oakdale and a reward of two
hundred dollars put up by the citizens for the capture
and conviction of the offenders.</p>

<p>"I will get a private detective to look into this,"
said Dr. Clay and did so. The detective, a quiet-looking
individual named Merivel, arrived the next
day and went to work immediately. But the task
proved too much for him, and inside of a week he
gave it up.</p>

<p>"I reckon I am out my machine and my valuables,"
said Roger, who was around once more and
as well as ever. "But I do wish I could lay hands
on the rascal who went through me!"</p>

<p>The days slipped by, and again Dave and his
chums devoted themselves to their studies. It was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

now growing colder and there was a suggestion of
snow in the air.</p>

<p>"It won't be long before we have snow and ice,"
said Sam. "Hurrah for some fine skating!"</p>

<p>"And snowballing," added Buster. "Don't
forget the fun we had last year."</p>

<p>"How we did pelt Pop Swingly!"</p>

<p>"And old Haskers!"</p>

<p>"You've got to be careful what you do to Haskers,"
said Shadow. "He is just watching for a
chance to get somebody into trouble."</p>

<p>"Do you remember how Dave beat Plum in that
race on the ice?" said Roger. "That was great!"</p>

<p>"By the way, Plum is cutting quite a dash
again," said Buster. "His father must have sent
him a lot of spending money."</p>

<p>"Then he can pay up those bets I heard about,"
said Macklin.</p>

<p>"He has paid them up, so I was told," replied
another student. "But I'll wager it made him
mad to do so."</p>

<p>"He had no business to bet against his own
school," said Sam. "It was a mean piece of business.
I've cut him dead for doing it."</p>

<p>What was said about Gus Plum having money
was true. He had paid all his debts and in addition
had spent several dollars in having a so-called
"good time" with Jasniff and Poole in a tavern on
the outskirts of Rockville. But he was not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>

particularly happy, if one was to judge by the
worried and scared look that often showed itself on
his face. At times it looked as if he wanted to
draw away from Nick Jasniff, but that student
clung to him closer than ever.</p>

<p>One Friday afternoon Dave, Roger, and Ben
got out of school a little early and resolved to walk
to Oakdale, just for the exercise and to buy a few
things of trifling importance. They were soon on
the way, and arriving at the town lost no time in
making their purchases. In Oakdale they met
Mrs. Fairchild and asked her if she had heard anything
concerning the robbery at her house.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," said the widow; "and I suppose
I never shall."</p>

<p>With their purchases in their pockets, the students
left the town and started on the return to the
academy. As it was nipping cold, they walked
rapidly, only stopping on the way to pick up some
chestnuts which were handy.</p>

<p>Each had his pocket filled with chestnuts, when
all heard a commotion around a bend of the
road.</p>

<p>"What's that?" questioned Dave, looking
ahead.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a runaway!" exclaimed Ben.</p>

<p>"If it is we had better be getting out of the
way," said Roger. "I have no desire to be run
over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The noise came closer and from a distance they
heard a man shouting wildly.</p>

<p>"Sthop! Sthop, I said! Vot you vants to run
avay for, annahow?"</p>

<p>"It's Zumm, the baker!" cried Dave. "His
horse must be running away!"</p>

<p>The sounds of hoofs could now be distinguished,
and in a moment more the steed came in sight,
dragging a baker's wagon behind him. The vehicle
swayed from side to side, threatening to go over
any instant.</p>

<p>"Look out!"</p>

<p>"He is running away and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"Where is Zumm?"</p>

<p>"He must have been thrown out!"</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the frightened horse.
He was less than a hundred feet away when he
swerved to one side, running two of the wheels of
the wagon into some low bushes.</p>

<p>"I am going to stop him if I can!" cried Dave,
with sudden determination.</p>

<p>Before Ben or Roger could stop him he was out
in the road and leaping for the head of the frightened
horse. He caught hold of the bridle and
hung fast.</p>

<p>"You'll be killed, Dave!"</p>

<p>"Don't go under his feet!"</p>

<p>"Sthop him, sthop him!" came from the German
baker who owned the outfit. He was running

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

after the horse and wagon as rapidly as his somewhat
bulky form permitted.</p>

<p>Dave paid no attention to the cries but clung
fast. The horse did a good deal of dancing and
prancing but it was of no avail. Finally he backed
into the bushes until the back of the wagon struck
a tree, and there he remained, trembling violently
in every limb.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Dave!" sang out Ben, in admiration.
"I must say, you know exactly how to
handle a horse."</p>

<p>"Pick up those lines," panted Dave, and stepping
forward, Roger did so. Then Ben came up
on the other side of the frightened animal and soon
they had the horse completely subdued and standing
quiet.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is he all right, yes?" panted the German
baker, coming up all out of breath.</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Dave. "He had a big
scare, though."</p>

<p>"Yah, dot's so."</p>

<p>"What made him go off?"</p>

<p>"Noddings but a biece of baber in der road.
Ven he see dot, he got so oxcitements like neffer vos
alretty!"</p>

<p>"Did he throw you out?" asked Ben.</p>

<p>"No, I vos got out to bick up some chestnuts,
and I let him valk along py himselluf. Den all to
vonce he kicks up his heels and runds avay kvick!

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

Next dime ven I go avay I ton't let him alone a
minute!"</p>

<p>The German baker was anxious concerning his
stock in trade, and while the boys continued to hold
the horse he climbed into the wagon to look after
his bread, and pastries.</p>

<p>"Chust vot I dink!" he groaned. "Dem nice
cakes vos all cracked alretty! Now vot I got to
do, tole me dot?"</p>

<p>"Cracked cakes?" queried Roger, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Yah. You see, I vos make some nice cakes for
Mrs. Dill's barty. Da vos sphoiled and now I haf
to make more."</p>

<p>"Don't throw them away," said Dave. "We'll
eat a cracked cake any day."</p>

<p>"So? All right, my poys. You do me a favor
to sthop mine horse, I vos gif you der cakes, yes,"
answered Mr. Zumm.</p>

<p>He was a liberal-hearted man and without delay
brought out several large cakes, somewhat crushed
and broken but still well worth eating. The sight
of such good things set Dave to thinking.</p>

<p>"Fellows, I've got an idea!" he said. "Let's
buy Mr. Zumm's cakes and pies and have a feast
to-night!"</p>

<p>"Just the thing!" came from both Ben and
Roger.</p>

<p>"I not sell you dem cakes," said the baker, when
the matter was explained to him. "You vos goot

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

poys, yes, and I like you. I gif you four pig cakes,
mit der pastepoard poxes to carry dem in."</p>

<p>"Thanks, you are very kind," said Dave, and
the others said the same. They insisted, however,
upon purchasing several pies, and also some chocolate
clairs. The goodies were put into several
pasteboard boxes, and then the boys hurried off
towards the Hall and Mr. Zumm resumed his
journey to town.</p>

<p>The three boys had some little difficulty in getting
into Oak Hall with their pasteboard boxes.
They were going up a back stairs when Nat Poole
caught sight of them.</p>

<p>"Hello, something doing, I'll be bound!" said
Poole to himself. "Guess I'll watch and see what
it means!"</p>

<p>He crouched out of sight in a dark angle of the
hallway and allowed Dave, Roger, and Ben to
pass him. Then, when the dormitory door was
closed, Nat Poole tiptoed up to it.</p>

<p>"Put the cakes on the top shelf," he heard Dave
say. "The pies can go over in that corner."</p>

<p>"A spread!" murmured Nat Poole to himself.</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to start too early," came
in Ben's voice. "Let us make it exactly midnight
just for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"That suits me," answered the senator's son.
"Who is to be invited?"</p>

<p>This was talked over, and it was decided to ask

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>

all the inmates of Dormitories No. 11 and 12 and
also a few of the students in No. 8, including Henshaw
and Babcock.</p>

<p>"But we want to be very quiet about it," cautioned
Dave. "If Haskers should hear of it, he'd
make all the trouble he could for us."</p>

<p>"Mum's the word, and I'll tell the other fellows
so," answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Don't let Plum, or Poole, or Jasniff get an inkling
of this," cautioned Ben. "They would like
nothing better than to spoil our fun."</p>

<p>"Yes, we certainly must be careful of that
crowd," answered Dave.</p>

<p>The three boys remained in the dormitory for
quarter of an hour, talking matters over and making
their arrangements for the midnight feast, and
Nat Poole took in every word that was said.
Then, as Dave, Ben, and Roger started to come
out into the hallway, Poole ran off and managed to
get down into the dining hall ahead of them.</p>

<p>"I've got news," he whispered to Gus Plum,
who sat beside him. "I'll tell you all about it
after supper."</p>

<p>"What kind of news?" questioned the bully.</p>

<p>"About a feast. The Porter crowd expects to
pull off something big to-night, and I know exactly
how we can block their game and land them in all
kinds of trouble!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
<span class="small">MORE PLANS THAN ONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Dave</span></span> and his chums waited impatiently for bed-time
and in the meanwhile the invitation to participate
in the coming feast was extended to all who
had been mentioned as possible guests. All accepted
with pleasure, and Babcock said he expected
to have a "whang-bang time," whatever that might
mean.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock Dave and Roger got ready to
retire to the dormitory. They were just going upstairs
when Chip Macklin came rushing up to
them.</p>

<p>"Come with me," cried the small student, in
breathless tones.</p>

<p>"Where to?" questioned Dave.</p>

<p>"Never mind&mdash;come on, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>Seeing that something unusual was up, Dave and
Roger followed Macklin to a back hallway. Here
the small student looked around cautiously, to
make sure that they were not being observed.</p>

<p>"It's all off!" were Macklin's first words. "The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

sooner you get rid of that cake and stuff the
better!"</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" demanded Dave.</p>

<p>"I just overheard Nat Poole talking to Plum and
Jasniff. They mentioned your name and something
about breaking up a feast, and I made up my
mind something was in the wind. I don't like to
play the sneak any more"&mdash;Macklin got red as he
said this&mdash;"but I felt I had to in this case. Poole
told his cronies all about the stuff hidden in our
dormitories and about the feast to be had at
midnight, and they planned to go to old Haskers
and to Dr. Clay and have us all caught red-handed!"</p>

<p>At this announcement the faces of Dave and
Roger fell for a moment.</p>

<p>"So you'd better get the stuff out of the way at
once," went on Chip Macklin.</p>

<p>"Tell me just what was said," said Dave, after
an awkward pause, and Macklin did as requested.
As he proceeded Dave's eyes lit up in sudden merriment.</p>

<p>"So that is their game," he said. "Well, we'll
pay them back,&mdash;just wait and see!"</p>

<p>"One thing is certain, the feast is off," said
Roger, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," answered Dave. "Didn't you
hear what Chip said? They are going to rouse up
Haskers and Dr. Clay about eleven o'clock, so as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>

to catch us red-handed. What's the matter with
having our little jollification before that time?"</p>

<p>"Good for you, Dave! But we'll have to be
careful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, and I'll fix the whole thing,"
replied Dave.</p>

<p>It was not long after that when all the pupils of
Oak Hall retired to their dormitories. In the
meantime Dave lost no time in going among his
chums and acquainting them with the new order of
things.</p>

<p>Dave's plan worked like a charm. He rightfully
guessed that Nat Poole would be listening at
one of the dormitory doors. Accordingly he spoke
in a loud voice after the door was locked.</p>

<p>"We'll have to wait until twelve o'clock before
we touch a mouthful," he said. "In the meantime
let us fix that lemonade and those other things.
All of the other fellows will come in at exactly
quarter to twelve. The feast is to last from twelve
to one o'clock."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I've got to wait until twelve o'clock,"
said Ben, in an equally loud tone. "But if that is
the rule of this club, why, I'll have to obey."</p>

<p>"Those other good things won't arrive until
quarter to twelve," said Roger.</p>

<p>So the talk ran on until the boys were undressed
and ready to retire. Then the lights were put out
and all became quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>In the darkened hallway Babcock was on guard.
Soon he came in with a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>"You've fooled 'em completely," he whispered.
"They have arranged to call up the doctor and old
Haskers at exactly half-past eleven, and they are
going to pounce in here just a few minutes after
twelve,&mdash;when they expect everything to be in full
blast. Plum says he will help smash down a door,
if it is necessary."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't be necessary," answered Dave,
dryly.</p>

<p>As soon as all was quiet, the good things were
brought forth and all the invited guests lost no
time in "making themselves at home," as Buster
Beggs expressed it. Growing boys always have
tremendous appetites, and it did not take long for
the larger portion of the cakes and pies to disappear.</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Sam Day, at last. "I must let
up, I am too full for utterance."</p>

<p>"I can't eat another mouthful," said Polly Vane,
as he finished a chocolate clair. "It was delicious,
though."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," said
Shadow, who sat on the edge of a table eating a
quarter of a pumpkin pie. "A poor boy went to a
Sunday school picnic, and when eating time came
he filled up on sandwiches and cake and lemonade
until he was ready to burst. Then they brought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

around some ice-cream. 'Johnny,' says a lady,
'you'll have some ice-cream, won't you?' Johnny
looked at her for a minute, his face full of sorrow.
'Can't,' says he. 'Why not?' says the lady. 'Because,'
says he, 'I&mdash;I kin melt it, ma'am, but I can't
swaller it!'" And a laugh went up.</p>

<p>"What are you putting away?" asked Roger of
Dave, who was filling two large paper bags with
cake crumbs and pie crusts. "Going to feed the
birds?"</p>

<p>"No, I've got a little plan. Won't these do
more good in Plum's dormitory than in ours?"</p>

<p>"Eureka!" shouted Buster, and then checked
himself. "It's a splendid plan!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Wait till they go off to rouse up the doctor and
old Haskers," said Ben.</p>

<p>"That's what I had in mind to do."</p>

<p>The boys assembled went over the dormitories
with care, cleaning up every evidence of the feast.
Everything that was left was put in paper bags,
which Dave had provided. Then came a rather
tedious wait on the part of the majority, Dave and
Roger meanwhile slipping out to learn what the
enemy was doing.</p>

<p>At last came the opportunity for which Dave
was waiting. He saw Poole, Plum, and Jasniff
leave their dormitory and hurry towards the rooms
occupied by the master of the Hall and his second
assistant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"There they go, Dave!"</p>

<p>"I see them, Roger. Quick! back to the room
with you!"</p>

<p>They ran to their own dormitory and in a minute
reappeared with the bags of broken cake and pie
crusts. With these they rushed to the dormitory
occupied by the bully of the school and his cronies.
The door was ajar and all was dark inside, the students
not in Poole's plot being sound asleep.</p>

<p>With deft hands Dave and Roger distributed
the broken cake and the pie crusts, putting some on
a table, some on a desk, a portion in the beds occupied
by Plum, Poole, and Jasniff, and the remainder
on the window sill and the floor. Then
they overturned a chair, and shoved one of the
beds partly against the door, so that it could not be
readily closed.</p>

<p>"Now for the alarm!" cried Dave, and lit
several gas jets. Then he and Roger set up a
sudden yell and ran with might and main for their
own room.</p>

<p>Dr. Clay and Job Haskers had just been
awakened by Poole and his cronies when the alarm
sounded. This aroused Andrew Dale and fully
two score of students, and all rushed into the hallways
to learn what it meant.</p>

<p>"A feast in Dormitory 12, eh?" said the worthy
master of Oak Hall. "I'll see about this!" And
he donned his dressing gown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time he reached Dormitory 12 the whole
school was in an uproar. Some thought there
might be a fire, and there was great excitement.</p>

<p>"If the place is on fire, I want to get out!" cried
one student.</p>

<p>"There is no fire!" answered Dave. "I think
it's a false alarm."</p>

<p>"Didn't the alarm come from Plum's room?"
asked one pupil.</p>

<p>"I think it did," answered another.</p>

<p>"Let us go see what is up!"</p>

<p>Many rushed in that direction, followed by Andrew
Dale. Then came a cry of astonishment
from the first assistant.</p>

<p>"What does this mean? A feast, I declare."</p>

<p>"A feast!" said Dr. Clay, who was in the rear.
"I was told there was a feast going on in Dormitory
No. 12!"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself, Doctor."</p>

<p>"I do see," answered the master of the Hall,
severely. "Plum, what does this mean?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I don't know," stammered the bully.
He was so amazed that he could not collect his
senses.</p>

<p>"Poole, can you tell me what this means?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, sir. I&mdash;I haven't had a thing, sir."</p>

<p>"Jasniff, what about this?"</p>

<p>Nick Jasniff shrugged his shoulders. "I thought

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

there was something going on in Porter's room.
Poole said so."</p>

<p>"Well, who sounded that alarm here?" thundered
Dr. Clay.</p>

<p>To this question there was no answer.</p>

<p>"We had better look in No. 12," suggested Job
Haskers, who had just come up, wrapped in a
flannel robe and wearing slippers.</p>

<p>The doctor and his assistants turned to the
dormitory occupied by Dave and his chums, and
then looked into the bedroom adjoining. Everything
was as clean and orderly as could be. The
boys were up, but they were not dressed.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" asked Buster Beggs,
sleepily. "Oh, Doctor, is that you? I thought I
heard some noise."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear the alarm?" asked Dave. "I
thought it woke up everybody."</p>

<p>The doctor said little but looked around the
rooms with care, and so did Job Haskers.</p>

<p>"Some mistake evidently," muttered the assistant.</p>

<p>"I am going to find out what the crumbs in that
other dormitory mean," answered Dr. Clay.</p>

<p>He passed out, and meeting Poole in the hallway
caught the pupil by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Just come with me," he said, and led the way
back to the room Nat occupied with his cronies.
"Now, explain this!" he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course poor Nat Poole could not explain, and
neither could Plum nor Jasniff. They tried to tell
their story, but for once the doctor was too impatient
to listen.</p>

<p>"As there was no cause for that alarm, I want
you all to go to bed," said he, after listening to a
few words. "It is midnight and I want all of you
to get your night's rest. In the morning I'll make
an investigation."</p>

<p>"What of this muss?" faltered Poole.</p>

<p>"Clean it up, every bit of it!" thundered the doctor,
and passed out and to his own room once more.</p>

<p>"I won't touch the stuff!" snarled Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"Neither will I," came from Plum.</p>

<p>"Nor I," added Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Are you going to disobey?" demanded Job
Haskers, who had remained on the scene.</p>

<p>His manner was so menacing that the three students
shrank before him.</p>

<p>"It wasn't our fault&mdash;&mdash;" began Plum.</p>

<p>"Enough. I can see through your doings.
You tried to get others into trouble to hide your
own tracks. This plot will not work with me. In
the morning you must clean this apartment
thoroughly, or I will punish you severely!" And
having thus delivered himself Job Haskers stalked
off, leaving Plum, Poole, and Jasniff the maddest
students Oak Hall had ever known.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE FIGHT IN THE GYMNASIUM</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"This</span></span> is some more of Porter's doings,"
growled the bully of Oak Hall, when he and his
cronies found themselves alone.</p>

<p>"That's it," agreed Jasniff. "Confound him,
I'd like to wring his neck!"</p>

<p>"I suppose they had their feast on the quiet,"
grumbled Poole. "We were foolish that we did
not watch them more closely."</p>

<p>The three went to bed and in the morning set to
work to clean up the dormitory. Then they had
to go downstairs, to be interviewed by Job Haskers,
who gave them some extra lessons to learn,
as a punishment. He would listen to no explanation
from them, happening to be in a thoroughly
bad humor himself.</p>

<p>The next few days proved unusually cold, and
then came a snowstorm which covered the ground
to the depth of several inches. The students got
as much fun out of the downfall as possible, snowballing
each other with great glee. They also took

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

shots at Pop Swingly and Horsehair while the pair
were engaged in cleaning off the walks.</p>

<p>"Hi! hi! stop that!" roared Swingly, as a snowball
from Ben took him in the back. Then one
from Roger knocked off his hat. At the same time
Dave, rushing by, threw some loose snow down
Jackson Lemond's back.</p>

<p>"Whow!" spluttered the driver, dropping his
broom and working at his neck. "Who did that?
Birr! it's as cold as a cake o' ice!" And he began
to shiver and dance around.</p>

<p>"This weather will surely make ice," said Sam,
and he was right, for that night several inches of
ice formed on the river, and this made all the students
look forward eagerly to the time when there
would be skating.</p>

<p>Frank Bond had quite recovered from the shock
he had received at the hands of Plum and his cohorts.
But he was still the pale, delicate, and nervous
boy as of old and shrank from contact with the
more boisterous students. He appreciated what
Dave and his chums had done for him and did his
best to give the bully of the Hall a wide berth.
He was a studious lad, and soon a warm friendship
sprang up between him and Polly Vane and they
often studied their lessons together, Polly giving
the younger lad all the assistance he could.</p>

<p>During those days Dave looked eagerly for letters
from the Wadsworths, Caspar Potts, and his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>

Uncle Dunston. The letters came and were full
of kind words and best wishes, yet the communication
from his uncle filled him with anxiety. In part
this letter read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Strange as it may appear, I have not yet received
a line from your father or your sister Laura.
I cannot imagine where they can be that they do
not send word of some kind. If they had received
even one letter from me concerning you, I feel sure
your father would not lose a moment in answering.
I have sent to a dozen places for information, but
all in vain."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"This is certainly a mystery," Dave said to
Roger. "What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shouldn't worry too much," answered the
senator's son, hopefully. "Your father and sister
are probably traveling in some out-of-the-way place
in Europe where the letters and cablegrams haven't
reached them."</p>

<p>"Waiting is very hard, Roger."</p>

<p>"I know it must be. I suppose you want to
know what your father and sister are like."</p>

<p>"That's it, and I want to be with them, too," answered
the former poorhouse youth.</p>

<p>Dave wanted to find Ben, to get a book the latter
had been reading. He was told that Ben was
down to the gymnasium and so strolled in that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>

direction. The building was almost deserted, not
more than half a dozen students being present.</p>

<p>In one corner was Gus Plum and not far away
Jasniff lounged on a bench. Between the pair
stood Frank Bond, his face having a white and
scared look upon it.</p>

<p>"Please, Plum, I don't care to do such things,"
Frank was saying. "I'd rather you'd excuse me."</p>

<p>"You'll do what I want you to do!" answered
Plum, brutally. "You can't back out now."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to&mdash;&mdash;" began the small boy,
when of a sudden the bully of Oak Hall caught
him by the ear.</p>

<p>"See here, you imp, you listen to me!" snarled
Plum. "I haven't forgotten what trouble you got
me into before. Now you mind me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let go, please let go!" screamed Frank.
"Don't pull my ear off!"</p>

<p>He tried to break away, but the bully held him
fast. The next moment, however, Dave stepped
between.</p>

<p>"Plum, I want you to let Frank alone," said
Dave, quietly but firmly, and at the same time looking
the bully squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Look here, this is none of your affair," blustered
Plum.</p>

<p>"Let him go, I say&mdash;and at once," and now
Dave clenched his fists.</p>

<p>"You want more trouble with me, eh?" growled

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>

Plum, releasing the small boy and sticking his chin
in Dave's face.</p>

<p>"No, I do not want trouble, but I am able to
meet it if it comes," answered Dave, not budging
an inch. "You ought to be ashamed to bulldoze
such a small chap as Frank. Why don't you leave
him alone, as the doctor told you to do?"</p>

<p>"See here, I don't want you to preach to me!"
roared Plum. "I know my own business and I
don't want you to put in your oar!"</p>

<p>"That's the talk," came from Jasniff.</p>

<p>Instantly Dave swung around on his heel.</p>

<p>"This is certainly none of your business, Jasniff,"
he said, coldly.</p>

<p>"Ain't it? Well, Gus is my particular friend,
and what concerns him concerns me," blustered
Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, let us go away," whispered Frank,
growing more frightened than ever.</p>

<p>"You can go away if you wish, Frank. I am
not afraid of these two bullies; Plum knows that,
even if Jasniff does not."</p>

<p>At this home thrust Gus Plum winced, for he
had not forgotten the drubbing received from
Dave in times gone by. Jasniff, however, was undismayed,
and striding closer, he pushed in between
Plum and Dave.</p>

<p>"I've heard of the unfair advantage you once
took of Gus, but you can't take such an advantage

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>

of me," he said, loudly. "I am not afraid of anybody
in this school, and I want you to know it."</p>

<p>His manner was so offensive that it caused the
quick blood to rush to Dave's face. Plum fell
back and so did Frank Bond. There was a moment
of suggestive silence.</p>

<p>"Jasniff, I never took any unfair advantage of
Plum, and everybody in this school knows it," said
Dave, steadily. "Plum is a bully,&mdash;and you appear
to be built the same way."</p>

<p>"So I'm a bully, eh?" stormed Nick Jasniff, putting
up his fists.</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to fight you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'd prefer not to dirty my hands on
you."</p>

<p>"Maybe you think you can lick me?"</p>

<p>"I am not doing any thinking on that subject."</p>

<p>"You can't talk to me like this&mdash;I won't allow
it," stormed Jasniff, putting up his fists again. "If
you want to fight, say so!" So speaking, he gave
Dave a sudden shove that sent him up against
Frank Bond.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, don't let him hit you!" gasped the
little lad. "He is so big and strong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dave did not answer&mdash;indeed, it is doubtful if
he heard the words. With a quick leap forward,
he caught Nick Jasniff by both arms and backed
him against the side of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let go!" screamed Jasniff, in a rage. "Let
go, I say!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Jasniff," returned Dave, still
holding the squirming student. "I don't want to
fight, but if you attack me, I'll not only defend myself,
but I'll give you the worst thrashing you ever
had in your life. I understand you thoroughly.
You are not only a bully but worse. Why Dr.
Clay allows you to remain here I don't know. I
want you to understand once for all you can't bulldoze
me."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" said Shadow, who had
walked up.</p>

<p>"Make him keep his distance, Dave," added
Buster, who was with the youth who loved to tell
stories.</p>

<p>"Bulldoze you?" stormed Nick Jasniff. "I'll
show you what I'll do&mdash;you poorhouse rat! I'll
make mincemeat of you!"</p>

<p>So speaking, he tore himself loose from Dave
and backed away a few steps. Then, with
clenched fists, he rushed in and aimed a heavy blow
at Dave's face.</p>

<p>The fist struck Dave's ear, for the latter did
what he could to dodge. Then came another blow
on the shoulder and one on the chin, all delivered
with lightning-like rapidity. Nick Jasniff was a
boxer, and could use his fists better than he could
learn his lessons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" shouted Gus Plum, gleefully. "That's
the way to do it, Nick!"</p>

<p>"Knock him out!" added Nat Poole, but keeping
safely in the background.</p>

<p>Dave backed away a step or two and again Jasniff
came at him, hitting him a light blow in the
arm. Then the boxer struck out again for Dave's
face.</p>

<p>But this blow did not land. Instead, Dave
leaped to one side and struck out himself, hitting
Jasniff in the left ear. This was followed by a tap
on the chin and another in the ribs. Jasniff tried
to land on Dave's chest, but failed, and Dave came
back once more with a crack on his opponent's nose
that caused the blood to spurt.</p>

<p>"A fight! A fight!"</p>

<p>"Look at that blow!"</p>

<p>"Jasniff is quick, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"First blood for Dave Porter!"</p>

<p>Again the two boys went at it, and for several
minutes blows were given and taken with remarkable
rapidity. With his skill as a boxer, Jasniff
had anticipated an easy victory; he was astonished
at the manner in which Dave parried some of his
blows. Around and around the gymnasium floor
circled the two boys, and as the shouting grew
louder the crowd increased.</p>

<p>The blood was now flowing not alone from Jasniff's
nose but also from a scratch on Dave's chin.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>

A few more passes and the two clinched, Jasniff
getting Dave's head under his arm. But with a
sudden turn Dave cleared himself, and hit his opponent
in the teeth, again drawing blood. Wild
with rage, Jasniff threw prudence to the winds and
leaped forward literally to crush the youth who
dared oppose him.</p>

<p>To him who loses his wits in such a situation as
this, all is lost. Blinded by rage Jasniff forgot to
guard himself and in a trice received a blow in the
left eye that made him see stars. Then, as he
plunged forward again, another swift and heavy
blow hit him squarely on the chin. His head went
up and back with a jerk, his form swayed from
side to side, and down he went on the floor with a
thud, and lay there like a log.</p>

<p>"My! what a blow!"</p>

<p>"Jasniff is knocked out clean and clear!"</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it in my life!"</p>

<p>So the cries ran on, while Nick Jasniff lay where
he had fallen. For the moment nobody approached
the prostrate youth, then Plum stepped
to his side, shaking, he knew not why.</p>

<p>"Nick! Nick!" he called, softly, as he raised the
fallen one's head. "I say, Nick!"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;shall I get some water?" faltered Nat
Poole. He too was shaking.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>While the water was being brought, Jasniff was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

helped to a sitting position. He was still all but
overcome. His cronies bathed his face and did
what they could to bring him around. In the
meantime Dave and his friends withdrew to another
corner of the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"So he knocked me out, eh?" snarled Jasniff,
when he was able to speak. "Just wait, I'll fix
him yet!"</p>

<p>"What, you're not going to fight again?" asked
Plum, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ain't I?" snarled Nick Jasniff. "I'll either
lick him, or he'll kill me!"</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE DISAPPEARANCE OF NICK JASNIFF</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Here</span></span> comes Jasniff again!" exclaimed Shadow.
"He looks mad enough to eat you up, Dave!"</p>

<p>"I thought he was done for," said Ben, who had
been wiping the blood from Dave's chin.</p>

<p>The crowd parted as the boy who had been
knocked out strode forward. His gait was unsteady
and from his eyes there gleamed a wild fire
awful to behold.</p>

<p>"Thought you had got rid of me, eh?" he cried.
"Well, I am not done for yet!" And with this he
struck Dave in the shoulder.</p>

<p>"If you want more you shall have it, Jasniff!"
retorted Dave, and struck out in return. Then the
blows came as rapidly as before. Dave was hit
twice in the chest and came back with a crack on
Jasniff's ear and one in the right eye that made the
youth see more stars than ever. Then, as they
circled around the floor, Dave watched his chance
and hit his opponent once more in the nose, causing
him to slip and pitch over on his side.</p>

<p>"Another knockdown!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jasniff, you had better give it up."</p>

<p>"Porter has the best of you, Nick."</p>

<p>If ever a boy was mad that boy was Nick Jasniff.
Half blinded from the blow in the eye he rolled
over and got up on his knees. Then he leaped to
his feet and ran to the wall of the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"I'll fix you! I'll fix you!" he snarled, and
pulled from its resting place a wooden Indian club
weighing at least three pounds. "You shan't crow
over Nick Jasniff, not much!"</p>

<p>"Hold up, what are you going to do?" cried
Ben, who stood near.</p>

<p>"I'm going to smash his head for him!"
answered Jasniff, and before anybody could stop
him he made a dash for where Dave was standing.
He swung the Indian club around so recklessly
that the crowd parted right and left to let him
pass.</p>

<p>Dave saw him approach and for the moment
hardly knew what to do. He had not dreamed of
such unfair play. It was easy to see that Jasniff
was in a frame of mind fit for any foul deed.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he cried, as the half-crazed lad leaped
before him. "Stop, I tell you!" And then as the
Indian club was swung over his head, he leaped to
one side and caught the other boy around the waist
with both arms. "Drop that club, you brute!"</p>

<p>"Drop the club! Drop the club!" came from
all sides, and in a twinkling Ben and Shadow

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

leaped in and wrenched the Indian club from Jasniff's
grasp.</p>

<p>"What an outrage!"</p>

<p>"Jasniff, you ought to be lynched for that!"</p>

<p>"This is a young gentlemen's school, not a resort
for toughs."</p>

<p>So the cries ran on. Jasniff tried to speak, but
nobody would listen to him, and even Plum and
Poole knew enough to keep silent. Dave retained
his hold a few seconds and then pushed his opponent
from him.</p>

<p>"I am done with you, Jasniff," said he, in a clear,
hard voice. "Done with you, understand? I'll
never dirty my hands on you again. If you dare
to molest me in the future, I'll hand you over to
the police. They are the only ones to handle such
a coward and brute as you."</p>

<p>Everybody heard the words and many applauded
them. Plum and Poole fell back and the
face of each grew scarlet. Nick Jasniff stood
stock still, breathing heavily. He wanted to do
something terrible,&mdash;but he did not dare. Dave
was pale and his jaws were firmly set. The tension
all around was extreme.</p>

<p>Then Jasniff moved, turning his back on Dave.
He looked at Plum and Poole, but they cast their
eyes to the ground. The crowd parted and Jasniff
walked away, slowly and unsteadily. In a
minute he left the gymnasium, slamming the door

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>

after him. There was a long sigh of relief over
his departure.</p>

<p>"Dave, I really think he meant to kill you!" said
Ben, coming up and clutching his chum by the arm.</p>

<p>"That's what he did!" said Buster Beggs.
"His eyes had a terrible look in them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are mistaken," answered Dave,
in an odd voice that sounded strange even to himself.
"But I&mdash;well, I don't propose to fight a fellow
with Indian clubs."</p>

<p>"He ought to be bounced out of this school,"
said Luke Watson.</p>

<p>"I'll never speak to him again," asserted Babcock.</p>

<p>"Wonder what Dr. Clay will say when he hears
of this fight?" said Roger, who had come in during
the wind-up. "I suppose he won't like it at all."</p>

<p>"He can't blame Dave," answered Ben.</p>

<p>"Porter started the quarrel by interfering with
me," said Gus Plum.</p>

<p>"What, Gus, do you stand up for Jasniff?" demanded
Shadow.</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't see how anybody can stand up for Jasniff,"
said Messmer. "I used to go with him, but
I am glad now that I cut him."</p>

<p>"I am not standing up for that Indian club affair,"
said Gus Plum, lamely, and walked away,
followed by Nat Poole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, you did fight him most beautifully,"
cried Frank Bond, his delicate face glowing. "Oh,
I wish I was as strong as you!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will be some day, Frank. Go out
in the fresh air all you can, and take plenty of
exercise here in the gym. Do you know what
made me strong? Working on a farm,&mdash;cutting
wood and plowing, and things like that."</p>

<p>Dave retired to the washroom and there bathed
his face and hands, and combed his hair. The
blood soon stopped flowing from his chin and the
scratch showed but little. Many wanted to congratulate
him on his victory, but he motioned them
away.</p>

<p>"Thank you, boys, but I don't want you to do
that," he said, quietly. "I want to tell you plainly
that I don't believe in fighting any more than Dr.
Clay does. It's brutal to fight, and that is all
there is to it. But every fellow ought to know
how to defend himself, and when he is attacked as
I was he has got to do the best he can for himself.
If Jasniff hadn't pitched into me roughshod I
should never have fought with him."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that, Porter?" asked a
voice from the other side of the washroom, and
Andrew Dale stepped out from behind a high
roller-towel rack. The first assistant teacher had
come in just as the encounter was ending.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Mr. Dale? Yes, sir, I do

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>

mean it," answered Dave. "Did you see the fight,
may I ask?"</p>

<p>"I saw Jasniff attack you with the Indian club,
but I was too far off to take a hand. You say he
attacked you first?"</p>

<p>"He did, and some of those here can prove it."</p>

<p>"That's right," said several of the students.</p>

<p>"What was the quarrel about?"</p>

<p>"It began between Plum and myself. Plum was
browbeating Frank Bond and I told him to stop.
Then Jasniff put in his say, and I told him it was
none of his business. Then he wanted to know if
I wanted to fight, and I told him I preferred not to
dirty my hands on him. Then he shoved me and
struck me two or three times. Then&mdash;well, then I
sailed in and knocked him down twice. Then
he got the Indian club, and you know the
rest."</p>

<p>"That's the truth of it, Mr. Dale," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," added another student, who had
seen the whole affair.</p>

<p>"Well, Porter, you had better come to the doctor's
office and we'll investigate further," said the
teacher, and a little later Dave found himself confronting
the master of Oak Hall. He told his
story in a straightforward manner and mentioned
the names of several who had witnessed the affair.
Then he was told he could go, and Frank was
called in, and then Ben, Shadow, Buster, and later

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

still Plum and Poole. The doctor questioned all
closely, and finally sent Andrew Dale after Jasniff,
but the youth could not be found.</p>

<p>"Has he left the school grounds?" questioned
Dr. Clay.</p>

<p>"I could not find that out," answered the assistant.
"Nobody seems to have seen him since he
left the gymnasium."</p>

<p>"Well, as soon as he shows himself, send him to
me."</p>

<p>"I will, sir."</p>

<p>"From what I can learn, he is a thoroughly bad
boy," went on the master of Oak Hall, beginning
to pace the floor of his office. "I must confess I
hardly know what to do with him."</p>

<p>"He is a bad boy, no doubt of that," answered
the teacher. "And he has a bad influence on some
of the other boys."</p>

<p>"You mean Plum and Poole?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right. Do you think he
ought to be sent from the school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless he will make an earnest endeavor
to mend his ways, Doctor."</p>

<p>"There is one trouble in the way, Mr. Dale.
His folks are now in Europe for the benefit of
Mrs. Jasniff's health. If I send him off, he will
have no place to go to."</p>

<p>"You can write to his father explaining the situation.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>

He may write to his son and that may help
matters."</p>

<p>"I have already determined to send a letter.
But Mr. Jasniff knows his son is wild&mdash;he wanted
me to tame him down. But I don't see how I can
do it. Supposing he had brained Porter!" Dr.
Clay shivered. "I should never have gotten over
it, and it would have ruined the school!"</p>

<p>"There is another thing to consider, sir," pursued
the assistant. "It may be that Porter will
write to his uncle about this, and his relative may
be afraid to let the boy remain here while Jasniff
stays."</p>

<p>"No, I questioned Porter about that. What do
you think he said?" The master of Oak Hall
smiled slightly. "He said he could take care of
himself and he could make Jasniff keep his distance.
He certainly has courage."</p>

<p>"He is the grittiest boy in the school&mdash;and one
of the best, too," answered Andrew Dale, heartily.
And there the conversation came to an end.</p>

<p>The fight between Jasniff and Dave was the sole
topic discussed that evening at Oak Hall. The
boys who had not witnessed the encounter could
scarcely believe that Dave had knocked the other
student down twice and blackened his eyes, and
they could scarcely credit the fact that Jasniff in his
rage and humiliation had attacked Dave with the
heavy Indian club. Some went to Jasniff's dormitory,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

only to learn that the student was missing.</p>

<p>In the dormitory Plum and Poole sat in a warm
corner, talking the affair over in a low tone. To
do them justice, both were horrified over the club
incident. Each had seen that awful look in Jasniff's
eyes and each had expected to see Dave
stretched lifeless on the gymnasium floor.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't think it of Nick!" whispered
Poole. "He certainly went too far."</p>

<p>"He was so wild he didn't know what he was
doing," answered Plum. "It doesn't pay to get
that way. If he had really killed Porter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say it, Gus! Why, it makes me
tremble yet," whined Nat Poole. "If Nick is
going to act like that, I'm going to have nothing
more to do with him. What if something had
happened? He might have dragged us into it
somehow&mdash;we've been so thick with him."</p>

<p>To this Gus Plum did not answer, but a far-away,
thoughtful look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>"It doesn't pay to be too thick with a fellow like
that," pursued Nat Poole. "He'll get you into a
hole some time or other."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right, Nat." Gus Plum drew a
long breath. "I wish&mdash;&mdash;" The bully of Oak
Hall suddenly checked himself.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I sometimes wish I had never been thick with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>

Nick. But he&mdash;&mdash;" Again Plum checked himself.
"By the way," he resumed, "did that new
allowance come in yet?"</p>

<p>"No. My dad wrote he wouldn't allow me a
cent until next month. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter." The bully drew another
long breath. "I thought perhaps you'd lend
me a little."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you had what you wanted!"
cried Poole, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I did have, but I&mdash;&mdash;Well, it doesn't matter,
Nat. I'll get along somehow." And then
Gus Plum heaved a deeper sigh than ever. Evidently
there was something on his mind which worried
him considerably.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">WHAT HAPPENED AT ROCKVILLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"Boys</span></span>, how is this for weather!" called out
Roger, the following morning. "Isn't it cold
enough to freeze the hind leg off a wooden horse?"</p>

<p>"I guess the bottom has dropped out of the
thermometer," answered Dave, as he followed
Roger in rising.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty good. My chin is a little swollen
and my shoulder is somewhat stiff, that's all."</p>

<p>"Wonder if Jasniff is back yet," said Ben.</p>

<p>All the boys wondered that, and Luke Watson
took it upon himself to dress in a hurry and go out
for information.</p>

<p>"Nothing seen of him yet," announced Luke, on
returning.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has run away for good!" cried
Buster.</p>

<p>"He's afraid the doctor will punish him
severely," said Polly Vane. "It was such a&mdash;er&mdash;outrageous
thing to do, don't you know."</p>

<p>"He's a tough boy," was Roger's comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, say, speaking of a tough boy puts me in
mind of a story I heard yesterday," said Shadow,
who sat on the edge of his bed, lacing his shoes.
"A young married lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gracious, Shadow, how can you tell stories on a
cold morning like this?" interrupted Dave.</p>

<p>"Shadow would rather tell stories than keep
warm," said Roger, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Maybe this is a hot one," said Ben, grinning.</p>

<p>"Now you just listen," pursued Shadow. "A
young married lady went and bought a barrel of
best flour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four X or Not At Home brand?" questioned
Buster, innocently.</p>

<p>"If you interrupt me I'll throw the soap at you,
Buster. This was a barrel of guaranteed flour.
Two days later she came back to the grocer with a
very indignant look on her face. 'That flour is no
good,' says she to Mr. Grocer. 'Why not?' says
the grocer. 'Because it is tough,' says the lady.
'I made doughnuts with it yesterday and my husband
thought they were paperweights!'"</p>

<p>"No well-bred lady would say that," came softly
from Dave.</p>

<p>"O my! what a pun!" cried Roger. "Well, she
wasn't well-bred, she was poor-bread." And then
a general laugh went up.</p>

<p>It was indeed cold, with the sun hiding behind a
gray sky and a keen north wind blowing. When

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>

they went below they ran into Babcock, who had
been down to the river.</p>

<p>"The ice is coming along finely," said Babcock.
"I think we'll be able to skate by to-morrow."</p>

<p>All the boys hoped so, and as soon as they could
went down to the river to look at the ice. It was
moderately firm and some lads were already sliding
on a stretch of meadow. But Dr. Clay would not
let them go on the river proper until it was safe.</p>

<p>That day the master of Oak Hall sent out
Andrew Dale and Swingly the janitor to look for
Nick Jasniff. But the search proved of no avail.
Wherever the student was, he managed to cover up
his tracks completely.</p>

<p>By Monday of the following week skating was
at its best, and many hours were spent by Dave and
the others on the ice. They skated for miles, and
also had half a dozen races, including one between
Dave, Roger, and Messmer, in which the two
chums came out even, with Messmer not far
behind.</p>

<p>During those days came word that Phil was
slowly but steadily improving. This news was
greeted with satisfaction by all his friends, who
hoped that he would soon be able to come to school
again.</p>

<p>"We can't get along without him," said Dave,
and Roger echoed the sentiment.</p>

<p>The senator's son had received word from two

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

of his friends, who were now students at one of the
leading colleges. Both belonged to a glee club
which was to give an entertainment at Rockville
Hall on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go to that entertainment and hear
Jack and Joe sing," said Roger. "I wonder if the
doctor will let me off?"</p>

<p>The matter was explained, and in the end it was
agreed to let the senator's son go to the entertainment,
taking Dave and Shadow with him for company.
As skating was so good, the students decided
to go by way of the river, walking the distance
from Rockville Landing to the hall where
the entertainment was to take place.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night when the three
started and all were in the best of spirits. There
were a few skaters out, mostly grown folk, so the
way was by no means lonely. They had plenty of
time, so did not hurry.</p>

<p>"We don't want to overheat ourselves," said
Roger. "Perhaps the hall will be warm, and then
we won't be able to stand it."</p>

<p>Arriving at Rockville Landing, they took off
their skates and left them at one of the boathouses.
Then they walked through the town, past the
brightly lighted shops, and stopped at one place for
some candy and glasses of hot chocolate.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" cried Dave, suddenly, as they
were leaving the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's up?" queried Shadow.</p>

<p>"Did you know that Gus Plum was coming
here?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did not," answered the senator's
son. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I just saw him over there. He passed around
that corner."</p>

<p>"Maybe you were mistaken in the person," ventured
Shadow.</p>

<p>"I think not."</p>

<p>"He may have come over,&mdash;to go to the entertainment,
just as we are doing."</p>

<p>"He doesn't care for music."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>The three boys walked to the corner and looked
down the side street. Nobody resembling the
bully of Oak Hall was in sight.</p>

<p>Five minutes later found them at the place
where the entertainment was to take place. Roger
took his chums around to the stage door and in,
and introduced Dave and Shadow to his friends,
and then the students from Oak Hall went around
to the front and secured seats near one of the
boxes.</p>

<p>The programme was a light and varied one&mdash;such
as are usually given by college glee clubs&mdash;and
Dave and his chums enjoyed it thoroughly.
One bass singer rendered a topical song, the glee
club joining in the chorus. This was wildly applauded,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

and the singer had to give at least a dozen
verses of the effusion.</p>

<p>"This is all right!" whispered Dave. "I wish
our glee club could do as well."</p>

<p>"Maybe it will&mdash;when the boys are as old as
these fellows," answered Shadow.</p>

<p>"These fellows are the best singers at the college,"
said Roger. "They can't get into the club
unless they have first-class voices."</p>

<p>The concert came to an end about half-past ten
o'clock, and Roger waited for a while, in order to
talk to his friends again. Then he, Dave, and
Shadow started on the return to Oak Hall.</p>

<p>Their course took them past the railroad station
and a row of small dwellings. Just as they were
between the station and the dwellings a light from
a street lamp fell full upon two persons standing
some distance away.</p>

<p>"Look! there is Gus Plum again!" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that is Nick Jasniff with him!" said
the senator's son, in a tone of great surprise.</p>

<p>"Let us go over and make sure," suggested
Shadow.</p>

<p>The three started across the street, and as they
did so Plum and Jasniff moved away in the direction
of one of the dwelling houses. Before they
could be stopped they had mounted the porch,
opened the door, and gone inside. Those outside
heard the door locked, and then all became quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I never!" came from Dave. "This is
certainly a mystery."</p>

<p>There was good cause for his words. The front
of the dwelling was entirely dark and the lower
windows had the solid wooden shutters tightly
closed.</p>

<p>"Shall I ring the bell?" asked Roger, after a
pause in perplexity.</p>

<p>"There is no bell to ring," answered Shadow.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't knock," advised Dave. "What's
the use? We may only get into a row."</p>

<p>"The doctor ought to know that Jasniff is here,"
said Roger.</p>

<p>"We can tell him that, even if Plum won't,"
added Shadow. "I agree with Dave, it will do no
good to knock."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know if they saw us," said Dave, as
he and his chums continued on their way up the
street.</p>

<p>"If they didn't it's queer why they should get out
of sight in such a hurry," replied the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Jasniff is going to get Plum to smooth
matters over with the doctor," was Dave's comment.
"He may be sick of staying away from the
Hall."</p>

<p>"Dave, what are you going to do if he does come
back?" asked Shadow, curiously.</p>

<p>"Do? Nothing."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid of him in the least?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I shall keep on my guard, for fear he may
play me some foul trick."</p>

<p>"I'd rather he'd go away for good."</p>

<p>"So would I," added Shadow.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. He may reform. If he
wants to reform, I'd like to give him the chance."</p>

<p>"He'll never reform," said Roger, decidedly.
"He is a bad egg through and through."</p>

<p>"Just what I think," said Shadow. "To my
mind, he is much worse than Plum or Poole."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that," returned Dave.</p>

<p>Arriving at the boathouse, they got out their
skates and put them on. While they were doing
this, two men, wrapped up in heavy overcoats,
walked up over the ice and passed down the street
in the direction from whence the students had
come.</p>

<p>"There's the long and the short of it," said
Roger, with a laugh. He had noticed that one
man was unusually tall and the other unusually
short.</p>

<p>"Well, men can't all be of a size," laughed Dave.
"That little man had all he could do to keep up
with the big fellow," he added.</p>

<p>The skate to the school was a fine one and they
arrived at Oak Hall just as the silvery moon was
sinking behind the distant hills. Swingly let them
in, and inside of quarter of an hour the boys were
in bed and in the land of dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was a busy one for Dave. He
had some extra hard lessons, to which he applied
himself with vigor. An examination was soon to
take place and he was determined to come out at
the top if it could possibly be accomplished.</p>

<p>"Gracious, I can't grind like that," said Roger,
but half in admiration.</p>

<p>"Dave has his eye on that medal of honor," said
Ben. "Well, it is certainly well worth working
for."</p>

<p>The weather had changed and by noontime it
was snowing furiously. Dave had not seen Gus
Plum in the morning, but the bully was at the dinner
table as usual. Shadow had reported seeing
Nick Jasniff in Rockville to the doctor, but had
given no particulars. Dr. Clay had said he would
look into the matter, and sent Andrew Dale to
Rockville for that purpose.</p>

<p>It was not until evening that the assistant
teacher returned from the neighboring town. He
had seen nothing of Nick Jasniff, although he had
hunted thoroughly and even visited the house
Shadow had mentioned.</p>

<p>"The house was locked up, and when I knocked
on the door nobody came to answer my summons."</p>

<p>This was as much as Andrew Dale could tell
concerning the missing student. But he brought
other news, which was flying over the country-side

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>

like wildfire. During the night thieves had broken
into the railroad station at Rockville, opened the
old-fashioned safe, and stolen nearly three hundred
dollars in money, some checks, and several bundles
of railroad tickets.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><br />
<span class="small">AN ICE-BOAT RACE</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"What</span></span> do you think of that?" cried Roger,
when the news was circulated among the boys.</p>

<p>"I think the deed was done by the same fellows
who robbed Mrs. Fairchild and Mr. Lapham,"
said Ben. "The authorities are dead slow that
they don't catch the rascals. They must certainly
be hanging out somewhere in this district."</p>

<p>"Boys, I've got an idea!" cried Dave. "Mrs.
Fairchild said the man she saw was rather tall.
Don't you remember the tall man we saw last
night?"</p>

<p>"To be sure, and the short fellow with him," exclaimed
Roger. "They may be the very rascals!"</p>

<p>"Let us tell the doctor of this," said Shadow,
and forthwith they went to Dr. Clay, who listened
to their story with interest.</p>

<p>"I will notify the authorities," he said. "How
did the men look in the face?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see their faces," answered Roger.</p>

<p>"One had a beard, I think," ventured Shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Both had reddish beards," answered Dave,
"and they had reddish mustaches, too."</p>

<p>This was as much as the boys could tell. Later
it was learned that the tall and the short man had
been seen before and it was pretty clearly established
that they had had something to do with all
of the robberies throughout that district. But the
men were missing, and what had become of them
nobody could tell. The local papers came out
with a full account of the robbery and not only
mentioned the money that had been taken but also
the names on the checks, and the lists of stolen railroad
tickets. These accounts Dave and his chums
read with interest.</p>

<p>"Say, I saw a funny thing just now," said Ben,
coming to Dave and Sam Day a little later, while
both were doing some sums in algebra. "I was in
the library and so were a lot of fellows, including
Plum and Poole. Plum has been on the sick list
to-day and wasn't downstairs when the news came
in about that Rockville affair. He took up one of
the papers and began to read about the robbery,
and all at once he staggered back. I thought he
was fainting. He grabbed the paper with all his
might and his eyes almost started out of his
head. He would have gone over, only Poole
caught him and led him to a chair. Then he
said his head hurt him and he went to his dormitory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was certainly queer," said Dave, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He acted just as if that news was some kind of
a blow to him," went on Ben.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it could affect him," said Sam
Day. "I guess it was just his sickness."</p>

<p>Sam did not know that Gus Plum had been seen
in Rockville the night the robbery occurred, and
Dave did not feel called upon to enlighten him.
But Ben knew, and he and Dave walked away to
talk the matter over, being joined a moment later
by Roger and Shadow.</p>

<p>"Plum was certainly in Rockville," said Shadow,
"but I don't see how that connects him with the
robbery." He was voicing a thought that had
come to the minds of all.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he was connected with it," said
Dave. "It's an awful thing to think a fellow is a
thief." He looked at Shadow, who understood
him thoroughly, as my old readers will understand.
"But&mdash;he was there with Jasniff," he added,
slowly.</p>

<p>"Do you think Jasniff had anything to do with
it, Dave?"</p>

<p>"I should hate to think any boy was a thief."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a fellow like Jasniff could open
that safe," came from Roger. "Those robbers
must have had regular burglars' tools."</p>

<p>"But what made Plum so afraid, or dumbstruck,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>

or whatever you may call it?" asked Ben. "It was
no small thing, I can tell you that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got scared, thinking he was at
Rockville with Jasniff at the time of the robbery,"
answered Dave. "He knows Jasniff is a kind of
outcast just now. Perhaps he himself suspects
Jasniff."</p>

<p>The students speculated over the affair for some
time. At first Dave thought it might be best to let
Dr. Clay know, but finally concluded to keep quiet
and see what the next few days would bring forth.</p>

<p>The bully of the school was certainly ill at ease
that day and also the next. He missed nearly all
his lessons and was sharply reprimanded by Job
Haskers.</p>

<p>"I've got a headache," he said. "It has ached
for several days. I wish you would excuse me."
And this getting to the ears of the doctor, he was
told to take some headache tablets and retire.</p>

<p>Some of the students who were of a mechanical
mind had built themselves ice-boats and these were
now being used on the river whenever the opportunity
afforded. Messmer and Henshaw had a
boat, and one afternoon after school they asked
Roger and Dave to go for a sail down the river.
Ice-boating was something of a novelty to Dave,
and he accepted the invitation gladly and so did the
senator's son.</p>

<p>The ice-boat built by Messmer and Henshaw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

was about twenty feet long, with a single sail, and
was named the <i>Snowbird</i>. It was by no means a
handsome craft, not being painted, but under
favorable conditions developed good speed, and
that was all the builders wanted.</p>

<p>"We didn't build her for beauty, we built her
for service," Henshaw explained.</p>

<p>"Well, as long as she'll go that's all we want,"
answered Roger. "I shouldn't give a cent for a
boat that was good-looking and couldn't get over
the ground."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see a boat get over the ground,
Roger?" asked Dave, quizzically.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;not exactly, but you know what I
mean, Dave."</p>

<p>"So I do, and I agree with you."</p>

<p>The start of the trip was made in fine shape,
and for a little while they sailed along in company
with two other ice-boats belonging to other students.
But then the others turned back, and the
<i>Snowbird</i> continued on the course alone.</p>

<p>"This is certainly grand!" cried Dave, enthusiastically.
He was sitting at the bow, holding
fast with one hand and holding on his cap with the
other. "My! but we are rushing along."</p>

<p>"It's just the right kind of a breeze," said Henshaw.</p>

<p>"Beats skating, doesn't it?" came from Roger.
"We must be making about a mile a minute!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"We won't dare to go too far," said Messmer.
"Remember, we've got to get back, and that will
take longer."</p>

<p>"Maybe the wind will change."</p>

<p>"No such luck, I am afraid."</p>

<p>On they went, the runners of the <i>Snowbird</i> making
a sharp skir-r-r on the smooth ice. They were
passing an island and as they reached the end they
came in sight of another ice-boat, carrying a number
of boys in military uniform.</p>

<p>"Hello! there is an ice-boat from Rockville
Military Academy!" exclaimed Dave. "That's a
pretty good-looking craft." This was a deserved
compliment, for the ice-boat was gayly painted and
decorated with a small flag.</p>

<p>"Hello!" yelled one of the Rockville students,
as the other craft came closer. "Where did you
borrow that old tub?"</p>

<p>"From the fellow who swapped it for that barn-door
you're riding on," retorted Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll give you ten cents for it," went on another
Rockville cadet.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but we don't want to rob you," answered
Roger, merrily.</p>

<p>"Maybe you think you can beat us," said Henshaw,
who had been eying the other ice-boat
critically.</p>

<p>"We don't think so&mdash;we know it," was the quick
rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come ahead then, and prove it," exclaimed
Messmer.</p>

<p>In a moment more the race was on. There was
a straight course of two miles ahead and over this
the rival ice-boats flew, at first side by side. Then
an extra puff of wind took the Rockville craft
ahead.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you!" cried one of the cadets.
"You're too slow for us. Good-by!"</p>

<p>"You're not leaving us yet," answered Henshaw,
who was steering, and he threw the <i>Snowbird</i>
over a bit from the shore. The wind was coming
over the top of a hill and now both craft got the
full benefit of it. On they rushed, with Rockville
slightly ahead. Then, slowly but surely, the Oak
Hall boat began to crawl up.</p>

<p>"We are gaining!" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I only had a bellows, to help make
wind!" sighed the senator's son.</p>

<p>They had still half a mile to go when of a sudden
the <i>Snowbird</i> shot ahead. Those on the
Rockville craft were amazed and their faces
fell.</p>

<p>"Here is where we beat you!" cried Henshaw.
"Good-by! We'll tell 'em you are coming."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to grass!" growled one of the Rockville
cadets, and then the <i>Snowbird</i> continued to forge
ahead, leaving the rival ice-boat far behind.</p>

<p>"They feel sick," said Dave. "I must say I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>

didn't think this ice-boat could do it. You've certainly
got something worth having."</p>

<p>"Even if we are not all painted up and haven't a
flag," added Messmer.</p>

<p>They continued on the course for quarter of a
mile further. Then they came to a number of
islands, and rounding one of these started to tack
back. Meanwhile the rival ice-boat passed on
down the river.</p>

<p>"Not so much fun in this," observed Roger. "I
like to rush right before the wind."</p>

<p>"That's like the small boy who wanted to go
down hill on his sled all the time and never wanted
to walk back," answered Henshaw. "But going
back will not be so much of a hardship as you
think."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll like it well enough," answered the
senator's son, quickly.</p>

<p>They were soon opposite one of the islands not
over a mile from Oak Hall. It was a lonely and
rocky spot and one seldom visited by any of the
students.</p>

<p>"Somebody is out skating here," said Dave, and
he pointed out two persons who were close to the
island.</p>

<p>A moment later the ice-boat was thrown over on
the other reach and came close to the island. Then
Roger uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>"The tall man and the short man!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can they be the robbers?" queried Dave,
quickly.</p>

<p>He watched the pair, and saw them disappear
behind some bare bushes which fringed the shore
of the island.</p>

<p>"Roger, I think we ought to try to find out something
about those fellows."</p>

<p>"I think so myself."</p>

<p>"If those are the rascals who robbed the Rockville
railroad station, we ought to try to capture
them," said Henshaw.</p>

<p>"How can we do that?" asked Messmer. "We
are not armed."</p>

<p>"Let us follow them up anyway," said
Dave.</p>

<p>This was agreed to by all on board the <i>Snowbird</i>,
and in a few minutes the craft was run close
to the shore and the sail was lowered.</p>

<p>"I am going to arm myself," said Roger, and
suited the action to the word by picking up a heavy
stick that lay handy. Seeing this, the others also
procured sticks, and thus armed, all made their
way to the spot where the two men had last been
seen.</p>

<p>"Here are their tracks in the snow," said Dave,
pointing to the drift which the wind had swept up
from the river. "It will be easy enough to follow
their tracks."</p>

<p>"We had better go slow and make no noise,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>

cautioned Roger. "If they hear us they'll be on
guard and may run away."</p>

<p>Slowly and silently after that the students followed
the trail, through the snow and over the
wind-swept rocks. They passed under some tall
trees, crossed a frozen-over gully, and then came
to where a pile of rocks appeared to bar their
further progress.</p>

<p>"They passed along this way!" whispered Dave,
pointing to the footmarks, close to the base of the
rocks. "Go slow now, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" interrupted Roger. "I hear voices."</p>

<p>"I see a cabin, just beyond the turn of these
rocks," said Henshaw. "The two men must be
there."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE CABIN ON THE ISLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">The</span></span> four boys came to a halt, to consider what
they should do next. They did not know but that
the two men might be desperate characters and
ready to fight hard if cornered. They might even
be ready to do some shooting.</p>

<p>"I'll go ahead and take a look around," said
Dave. "You others had better remain here for
the present."</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and with extreme caution
Dave made his way around a corner of the rocks
and along some bushes, to one side of the cabin.
The building was of logs, very much dilapidated,
having been erected by some campers many years
before.</p>

<p>As Dave came close to one of the windows of
the cabin he saw a man cross the floor in the direction
of a rude fireplace. Then a match was struck,
and some paper lit. Soon a fire was blazing in
the room, casting a ruddy glare over all.</p>

<p>Both men were present, each still wrapped in his
overcoat and with his hat pulled down over his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>

forehead. That they were the individuals he had
seen in Rockville the night of the concert and the
robbery the youth was quite sure.</p>

<p>Dave was anxious to hear what the two fellows
might have to say, and so crept closer to the window,
which was wide open. Near the window a
log was loose, leaving quite a crack, and by putting
his ear to this the boy made out nearly all that was
being said.</p>

<p>"We were simple, I think, to come here, Pud,"
said the tall man, as he threw some more wood on
the fire. "We ought to be miles away by this
time."</p>

<p>"I ain't going away yet, Hunk," was the reply
from the short man. "You know what I came for.
Well, I am going to stick it out."</p>

<p>"But it is getting more dangerous every day,"
pleaded the man called Hunk.</p>

<p>"Oh, you only think so."</p>

<p>"No, I don't. Didn't I read the papers,&mdash;and
didn't you read them too? They are after us, I
tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, they haven't got us yet."</p>

<p>After that there was a pause, during which one
of the men put some water in a pot to boil and
brought out some provisions in a flour bag.</p>

<p>"Who is next on that list of yours?" asked the
man called Hunk, presently.</p>

<p>"Paul Barbridge, and I want to do him up good.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>

He was the foreman of the jury that sent me up for
two years."</p>

<p>"Has he got money?"</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;leastwise, I am going to find out,"
and the speaker gave a low chuckle. "Oh, I ain't
going to let up until I run through the whole
twelve or their families. And then I am going to
strike the judge&mdash;and strike him good and hard.
I'll show 'em that they can't send Pud Frodel to
prison and not get paid back! I said I'd get
square when I was sentenced and I am going to
keep my word. Fairchild died on me, but I reckon
I fixed his widow for it."</p>

<p>There was another pause, during which both
men prepared to eat some of the provisions they
had brought with them. Dave was on the point
of rejoining his companions, when the men began
to speak again and now their words filled him with
amazement.</p>

<p>"You're a queer one, Pud," said the man called
Hunk. "A queer one, I must say. Sometimes I
wonder to myself how I can stick to you."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't got to stick if you don't
want to."</p>

<p>"I know that. But you want me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I like to have somebody, and&mdash;you like your
share, eh?" And the short man laughed harshly.
"I've been square, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to the cent&mdash;and that is why I stick to you.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>

But you do such queer things. Now, for instance,
those schoolboys&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bring that up again, Hunk. I
know just what I am doing. I told you that
before."</p>

<p>"Well, one of those boys may be all right, but I
shouldn't trust the other."</p>

<p>"Both of 'em want money&mdash;want it just as bad,
almost, as we do. One of 'em up and told me so."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When fellows like that want money&mdash;actually
want it&mdash;they get desperate. At such a high-toned
school they have to keep up a front, and they
can't do that unless they have got the coin in their
pockets."</p>

<p>"When are you going to see them again?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At the old mill, near Nabill's."</p>

<p>"Well, if you&mdash;&mdash;What's that?"</p>

<p>The speaker broke off short, as a sound from
outside reached his ears. Tired of waiting for
Dave, Roger and the other students had come
closer and Henshaw had stumbled over a loose
stone and gone crashing into a hollow among some
bushes.</p>

<p>"Somebody out there!" ejaculated Pud Frodel,
and caught up a club that stood handy.</p>

<p>"Maybe they're following us!" returned his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>

companion. "Come on and see. We don't want
to be cornered in a place like this."</p>

<p>"Oh, my ankle!" came in a painful cry from
Henshaw. He had given that member a severe
wrench.</p>

<p>"Some of the schoolboys!" cried one of the men.</p>

<p>"Let us get out," added the other.</p>

<p>"Are those two fellows we know in the crowd?"</p>

<p>"No, these are all strangers."</p>

<p>After having run out of the cabin, the two men
went in again. Then they seemed to suddenly disappear.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Dave!" sang out Roger. He could see
but little in the gloom of the coming night, for it
was now nearly supper time.</p>

<p>"I am here, Roger."</p>

<p>"Where are the men? And what kept you so
long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where the men are," answered
Dave, ignoring the other question. "They just
stepped back into the cabin."</p>

<p>"Look out that somebody isn't shot," said Messmer,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Are they the fellows we are after?" asked the
senator's son.</p>

<p>"I am pretty sure they are," whispered Dave.
"But I want to talk to you about it later," he added,
giving Roger's arm a knowing squeeze. "There
is something of great importance in the air."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think there would be&mdash;if these are the
thieves, Dave."</p>

<p>"It's more than that. But don't ask me about
it just now."</p>

<p>After some hesitation, the four boys entered the
cabin. The fire was burning brightly, so that they
could see with ease. All looked in consternation.
Not a sign of the two men was to be seen anywhere.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"They certainly came in here!"</p>

<p>"That is true&mdash;they did come in here," said
Dave. "Perhaps they are in hiding."</p>

<p>The boys began to search around the cabin and
presently the senator's son found a piece of a log
that was loose. He gave a push and it rolled
away, showing a dark hole, leading through some
thick bushes and past some rocks.</p>

<p>"This is the way they went!" he shouted. "It's
a clever outlet."</p>

<p>The passageway was so dark the boys hesitated
for a moment about entering it. Then Dave
caught up a firebrand and went in. Soon the
others heard him shout from some distance behind
the cabin.</p>

<p>"Come right through!" he called. "It's all
right."</p>

<p>They went through and next found themselves
under some tall trees. Beyond was an open space,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>

and here the tracks of the two men were plainly to
be distinguished. They led to the shore of the
island and disappeared on the ice beyond.</p>

<p>"They've gotten away from us," said Henshaw,
disappointedly. He was limping badly.</p>

<p>"How's the ankle?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"I gave it a bad twist, but I guess I can walk to
the ice-boat."</p>

<p>Nothing could be seen in the fast-gathering
darkness, and after remaining at the shore for a
few minutes, the four retraced their steps to the
dilapidated cabin. Here the fire was replenished
and the students looked around for evidence
against the two men.</p>

<p>"They are certainly the two men who committed
the robberies in this district," said Dave. "They
as much as admitted it themselves. The short,
stout fellow is the leader and he is doing the work
for a particular reason. He was once sent to
prison for two years. He vowed he would get
square on the twelve jurymen and the judge who
convicted him. So now he is going around robbing
one after another of the thirteen."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fairchild wasn't a juryman," said Messmer.</p>

<p>"No, but her husband was&mdash;the fellow mentioned
that."</p>

<p>"It's a pity we didn't catch them," said Roger.
"We got tired of waiting for you and were afraid

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>

you had gotten into some kind of trouble," he
added, to Dave.</p>

<p>They looked around the cabin with care, but
could find little outside of the provisions previously
mentioned. There were some evidences that the
men had been there a number of times, but that
was all.</p>

<p>"This is not their regular hanging-out place,"
said Dave. "They must have another resort&mdash;where
they have at least some of their plunder."</p>

<p>"I think the best thing we can do is to get back
to the Hall and notify Dr. Clay," said Roger.
"He can then set the authorities on their track."</p>

<p>This was considered good advice, and putting
out the fire, so that it might not destroy the cabin,
they left the place once more and started for the
spot where they had left the <i>Snowbird</i>.</p>

<p>To Henshaw the walk was a difficult one, and
the others had to help him over the trying places.
Consequently, when they at last reached the shore
it was pitch dark. A cold north wind caused all
to shiver.</p>

<p>"It will be no easy job steering back to the Hall
in this darkness," said Messmer. "A fellow can't
see fifty feet ahead of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the course well enough," answered
Henshaw.</p>

<p>The ice-boat was found exactly as they had left
it, and soon the craft was shoved out on the lake.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>

Then all got aboard, the sail was hoisted, and off
they started for Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"Phew! but it is getting cold!" was Dave's remark,
as he buttoned up his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Those men will have a cold walk, wherever
they may be going," returned Messmer.</p>

<p>"They said something about the old mill," answered
Dave. "I'll tell you the story after I've
seen Dr. Clay."</p>

<p>On and on sped the <i>Snowbird</i> with the wind
shifting in her favor. It was so cold the tears
streamed down the cheeks of all the boys and
Roger declared that his ears were about frozen.
They tried to look ahead, but could see next to
nothing.</p>

<p>"Henshaw, are you sure of your course?" asked
Dave, presently.</p>

<p>"I think I am," was the hesitating response.
"But it is dark, no two ways about it."</p>

<p>The wind now took another turn and the ice-boat
bore away to the left bank of the river. Henshaw
did what he could to bring the craft about,
but two minutes later came a grating jar and everybody
was pitched off into a snowbank, some heels
over head.</p>

<p>"I guess we've landed!" spluttered Roger, as he
pulled himself to his feet. "Henshaw, what did
you do that for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know we were going ashore," replied

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>

Henshaw, who had gone head first into the
snow himself. "Anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>One after another got up. Fortunately nobody
had been hurt. Messmer had some of the snow
down his back and Dave had some up his coat
sleeve. The ice-boat was as good as ever.</p>

<p>"Now we want to be more careful," said Dave,
as they hauled the craft on the lake once more.
"One such spill is enough."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Roger. Then the journey
was resumed, nobody dreaming of the accident so
close at hand.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX
<br /><br />
<span class="small">DAVE'S HEROISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">As</span></span> the ice-boat swept along Dave revolved in his
mind all that he had heard at the old cabin.</p>

<p>He could place but one meaning on the words
spoken by the two criminals regarding two schoolboys.
They must refer to Nick Jasniff and Gus
Plum.</p>

<p>"Can it be that those two are in with such rascals?"
he asked himself. "I might think it of
Jasniff, but I never dreamed Plum could be quite
so bad. And yet last season he did some pretty
crooked work with the valuable postage stamps
that disappeared."</p>

<p>On and on swept the <i>Snowbird</i>, through the
darkness of the night. It was growing colder
each moment, and the cutting wind made each of
the lads shiver. Dave wanted to tell Roger his
tale in full, but now was no time for connected conversation.</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the darkness loomed a strange
object, moving in almost the same direction as the
<i>Snowbird</i>. It was the ice-boat belonging to the
Rockville cadets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out!" yelled Henshaw, while Messmer
gave a scream of fright. Then both ice-boats appeared
to turn toward each other, there came a
grinding, rending crash, and in a twinkling Dave
found himself spinning on his back over the ice
with Roger beside him.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Dave he landed in such a
fashion that he received little more harm than a
thorough shaking up. He slid a distance of two
hundred feet and then came to a stop in a small
ridge of snow.</p>

<p>"Hello, I wonder if anybody is hurt?" he asked
himself, and got to his feet as quickly as possible.
He walked back to the scene of the collision and
soon ran into the senator's son.</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Roger; how about you?"</p>

<p>"Got shaken up, that's all."</p>

<p>"Help! help!" came faintly from one of the ice-boats,
and running back Dave and Roger saw Henshaw
on the ice, with the overturned <i>Snowbird</i> on
top of him. Close at hand lay the second ice-boat,
and it was plain to see that both craft were much
damaged.</p>

<p>Messmer was near, suffering from a cut on
his hand, yet he was willing to go to Henshaw's
assistance. The bow end of the <i>Snowbird</i> was
raised and Henshaw dragged himself forth.</p>

<p>"Are you badly hurt?" asked Dave, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"My left leg got a pretty good squeeze," answered
Henshaw, trying to limp around on the
member. "I am afraid I can't walk on it." And
he sat down on the edge of the overturned ice-boat.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the Rockville cadets were pulling
themselves together. All had been bruised
and scratched a little, but that was all. Their ice-boat,
too, had gone over, and the runners were
partly broken.</p>

<p>"That was your fault!" growled one of the
cadets, striding over to the students of Oak
Hall.</p>

<p>"No more our fault than yours," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>"You ran right into us."</p>

<p>"You did as much of the running in as we did,"
answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I got my leg hurt for fun?"
growled Henshaw.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" questioned another of the
cadets.</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Well, I am sorry for that."</p>

<p>The fact that Henshaw was hurt caused the
Rockville boys to become a little more friendly,
and two of them said they would do what they
could for the sufferer. No more was said about
the cause of the accident, which was in reality the
fault of both parties equally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing much could be done for Henshaw. It
pained him to stand on the injured leg and so he
remained sitting down. The other boys began to
inspect both ice-boats. It was found that they
were badly broken at the bow and both masts were
loosened. As a consequence, while they could be
used, progress on the river, even before the wind,
would be slow.</p>

<p>"This is too bad," observed Dave. "We ought
to get back to Oak Hall as soon as possible, and
tell the doctor what we have learned."</p>

<p>After a good deal of tugging both ice-boats were
righted and each party boarded its own craft. On
they went in the darkness and soon separated, the
craft from Rockville doing a little better than that
containing our friends.</p>

<p>"I don't think we'll get back to the Hall much
before midnight," said Dave, and this proved to be
the case. It lacked just ten minutes of that time
when they tied up at the boathouse. Henshaw's
leg was now stiff and the others had to carry him
to the door.</p>

<p>"Ha! so I have caught you!" exclaimed Job
Haskers, as he suddenly showed himself. "What
do you mean by coming in at this late hour?"</p>

<p>"We've had an accident&mdash;Henshaw is hurt,"
answered Roger.</p>

<p>At this announcement the teacher's face took on
a sour look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"An accident, eh? You are quite sure?" he
demanded, with a suspicious look at Henshaw.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure," grumbled the hurt one. "We
had a collision with another ice-boat, and when our
craft turned over I was caught underneath."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble there?" came in Dr. Clay's
voice, and he showed himself at the top of the
stairs and then came down. After asking a few
questions he had Henshaw taken to a private bed-chamber,
where the injured limb was carefully examined
and then bathed with liniment.</p>

<p>"I wish to see you in private, Dr. Clay," said
Dave. "Perhaps Morr and Messmer will want to
see you too."</p>

<p>"Very well, come into the office," answered the
master of Oak Hall, and led the way. He made a
light and then faced the three students who had
followed him.</p>

<p>In a plain, straightforward manner Dave told
of the visit to the rocky island and the old cabin,
and of what the two men had said. He did not
mention the talk about the two schoolboys, although
strongly tempted to do so. He said the
two men expected to go to the old mill, near Nabill's
farm, the next day.</p>

<p>"This is very important," exclaimed the doctor,
when he had finished. "I must notify the authorities
at once, and we must do everything we can to
capture the rascals."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can I do anything?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I think not. As you say one man is very tall
and the other very short, it ought not to be a very
difficult matter to recognize them if they show
themselves. The old mill is also well known, so
there can be no mistake."</p>

<p>"Of course, they may not go to the mill now,"
went on Dave.</p>

<p>"That is true. But I will have the authorities
keep a close watch all around this district and also
at the railroad stations. As he has been in prison
this Pud Frodel must be known."</p>

<p>After that the doctor told the boys they had
better go to bed, and they did so. But it was an
hour before Dave could get to sleep. Once he
thought of getting up and visiting Gus Plum's
dormitory, but gave up the idea, knowing that all
the others would want to know what was doing.</p>

<p>In the morning the weather changed. It was
not so cold, but the snow was coming down thickly
and the wind sent it swirling in all directions. Already
the ground was covered to a depth of several
inches, and there was no telling when the storm
would cease.</p>

<p>"This will make it hard to track those men,"
observed Roger, as he and Dave came down for
breakfast.</p>

<p>"Roger, I want to tell you something," said
Dave, and as the pair walked to a secluded corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of a hallway Dave told his chum what had
been on his mind since the visit to the lonely cabin.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! can this be true?" cried the
senator's son, in horror. "Can Jasniff and Plum
really be mixed up in this?"</p>

<p>"It looks like it to me, Roger," was Dave's slow
reply. "And yet I shouldn't want to say a word
until I was certain. Jasniff I know is bad,&mdash;and
so is Plum, for the matter of that. But there is a
difference between them."</p>

<p>"I know it, Dave. Jasniff is wicked at heart,
while Gus is more a bully and headstrong." The
senator's son paused. "What do you propose to
do?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of having a straight talk
with Plum. Of course, if he is really in with those
robbers I'll have to expose him."</p>

<p>The chums talked the matter over for several
minutes and then went in to breakfast. Plum was
there, but Dave noticed that the bully ate little.
Soon Plum arose and left the dining room abruptly.
Dave followed, why he could hardly tell.
But he had a feeling that he must follow Plum
then and there.</p>

<p>The bully of Oak Hall passed from the hall to
the coat room, and there donned his overcoat, hat,
and rubbers. Then he walked to a side door, and
opening it cautiously, stepped out into the howling
storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Dave was now certain something unusual was in
the wind, for the school session would begin in
twenty minutes and he knew Plum would not go
out in such a storm without good reason. Quickly
he donned his own coat, hat, and rubbers and followed
to the outside of the school building. He
saw Plum running across the campus and he followed.
Then the bully leaped the boxwood hedge
and came out on a road leading to a village called
Bagor, a short distance from Rockville.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is going to meet Jasniff," Dave
reasoned. "He must be pretty well upset. I
don't believe he even got permission to leave."</p>

<p>The road led through a wood and then up a long
hill. The snow was so thick that Dave had all he
could do to keep Plum in sight. The bully of the
Hall walked rapidly, his head bent low and his
hands rammed well down in his overcoat pockets.</p>

<p>The high ground at the top of the hill gained,
Plum struck off to the southeast, in the direction of
the railroad tracks. Inside of five minutes he
reached a point where the tracks ran through a
deep cut. On either side were tall trees, and the
sloping banks of the cut ran down almost to the
rails, now covered with snow.</p>

<p>At the edge of the cut Plum paused again. He
looked up and down the opening, as if undecided
in what direction to turn. Far away a locomotive
whistle sounded and a freight train appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
sight, rolling forward rapidly on a slight down-grade.</p>

<p>As the freight train came closer Plum prepared
to climb down the steep slope of the cut. All was
covered with ice and snow, and he had taken but a
dozen steps when he lost his footing and his hold
and rolled over and over. Then he struck a projecting
rock and the next instant pitched forward
on his head, rolled over and over once more, and
landed squarely on the tracks below!</p>

<p>Dave was close to the edge of the cut and saw
the whole occurrence. When Plum struck on his
head he uttered a deep groan, showing that he was
injured. Then, as he lay on the tracks, he did not
move.</p>

<p>"He is unconscious!" thought Dave, and a chill
of horror swept over him. He looked along the
cut. The freight train was sweeping forward,
directly for the unconscious youth. In half a
minute more it would reach Plum and run over
him. He heard a fierce whistle, as the locomotive
engineer gave the signal for brakes, and the engine
itself was reversed. But the grade was too great
and the train too heavy for a sudden stop.</p>

<p>Dave's heart leaped into his throat. Was Plum
to be ground up under his very eyes? He had no
great love for the bully, but at that moment his
heart went out to him as if he were a brother.</p>

<p>"I must save him&mdash;if I can!" he told himself.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>

"He must not be killed if I can help it!" And
then, throwing himself face downward, he slid
over the ice and snow to the bottom of the cut.
His hands and face were scratched, but he paid no
heed. As he touched the bottom he leaped up.
The train was less than fifty feet away, the wheels
grinding sharply on the tracks. He made one
wild leap forward, caught Plum by the feet and
dragged him out of harm's way. Then the train
rolled on, coming to a stop a few seconds later.</p>

<span class="small">GUS PLUM'S CONFESSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">"You</span></span> did this for me, you! Oh, Dave Porter,
how could you do it? How could you?"</p>

<p>It was Plum who spoke. He sat on a fallen
tree not far away from the railroad cut. His forehead
was swollen and there was a cut on his cheek,
but otherwise he had quite recovered from the
shock received. The train, after stopping for a
few minutes, had gone on, and the two youths were
alone.</p>

<p>Plum's voice was choked with emotion. He
had come to his senses to find Dave and the fireman
of the train bending over him. It was the fireman
who had told of Dave's brave deed.</p>

<p>"Pluckiest thing I ever see in my born days," the
fireman had said. "He came down the slope pell-mell
and hauled you off the track just as we hit the
spot."</p>

<p>Then the fireman and the train had gone on and
Dave had done what he could for the bully. Plum
was trembling like a leaf and found it next to impossible

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>

to control himself. Twice before he had
tried to speak but his voice had failed him.</p>

<p>"You are sure you are not hurt?" asked Dave.
He himself hardly knew what to say. The excitement
of the occasion had put him in a dripping
perspiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care if I am!" replied Plum. "I&mdash;I
wish&mdash;I wish I was dead!"</p>

<p>"Plum!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! I&mdash;I&mdash;but I can't talk about it.
And to think you did this for me, you! Why, I
thought you hated me!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did, Gus. But I didn't hate you
when I saw you on the tracks unconscious."</p>

<p>"You did more for me than I should ever have
done for you."</p>

<p>"Maybe not."</p>

<p>"I know it, Porter, for&mdash;well, you know how I
have hated you. But I am not going to be that
way any more&mdash;I couldn't!"</p>

<p>After this there was a silence. Each boy wanted
to say something, but hardly knew how to get at it.
Finally Dave broke the ice.</p>

<p>"Gus, what brought you to this spot this morning?"
he questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me! I was crazy, I guess. I
wanted to get away&mdash;I never wanted to see Oak
Hall or anybody again!"</p>

<p>"Were you going to run away?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess so&mdash;I don't know. I didn't sleep last
night nor the night before."</p>

<p>"Gus, tell me the truth, will you?" went on
Dave, boldly. "Are you working with those fellows
who robbed the Rockville railroad station and
those other places?"</p>

<p>"No! no! Oh, Porter! Dave! What do you
know about this&mdash;about me?" Plum's face grew
as white as the snow around them. "I&mdash;I heard
what you told Dr. Clay last night&mdash;I was listening
at the door. Do you&mdash;do you know anything
more?"</p>

<p>"I do and I don't, Gus. Those men said something
about two schoolboys, and I and some others
saw you in Rockville the night of the robbery.
More than that, I know what sort of a fellow Nick
Jasniff is, and you and he are always together."</p>

<p>"Dave, I didn't steal any money, I give you my
word I didn't! I was led along by Jasniff. I was
in debt and I needed money badly. Jasniff said he
knew where he could borrow some for me, and he
did get me fifty dollars. Then he introduced me
to that short man, who went by the name of Sloan,
and to the tall man, who went by the name of Carson.
It seems Jasniff knew Sloan, or Pud Frodel,
years ago, before he was sent to prison. The tall
man isn't over-bright and he is simply Pud Frodel's
tool. One day I was talking to the tall man and I
soon found out what sort of a crowd they were,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>

although the tall fellow didn't say so in so many
words. Then I wanted to cut them, and cut Nick
Jasniff too, but Jasniff said if I did, he'd write a
letter to Dr. Clay exposing me. Jasniff, after he
ran away from the Hall, went right in with the
robbers and he wanted me to go in, but I up and
told him I wouldn't have anything more to do with
him and with those rascals."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Gus!" cried Dave, heartily. "I
am glad to hear that."</p>

<p>"Wait, I am not done yet. Jasniff tried to
smooth matters over and asked me to meet him at
Rockville. I did so, as you know, and I met the
men too. We had a meal together and I was
drugged. After that I don't know what I did.
When I was myself again Jasniff said I had helped
to rob the railroad station."</p>

<p>"But did you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, although I remember being
taken to somewhere in a carriage and seeing the
lights of the station. After that, I had some hot
words with Jasniff and came back to the Hall.
Then Jasniff sent a letter, stating he would surely
expose me if I opened my mouth to anybody.
Then came your news to the doctor. If those men
are captured, and Jasniff with them, they will
surely drag me into the affair! How am I going
to face it&mdash;especially after what happened last
summer? Oh, I wish I was dead!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Gus Plum's lips began to tremble and the tears
stood in his eyes. His better nature was struggling
to the surface, and he was a most miserable object
to behold. Dave pitied the lad from the bottom
of his heart.</p>

<p>"It certainly does look black, Gus," he said.
"But if you are not guilty I'd face the music if I
were you. If those men are brought into court
you can turn witness against them, and against
Jasniff too. I know it will hurt you in school&mdash;but
if you don't want to stay here you can go to
some other academy."</p>

<p>After this Dave talked to Gus Plum for a full
half-hour, giving the other boy his best advice.
Both lads were so excited that neither minded the
snow and the cold. Plum was in a deeply penitent
mood and during the course of the conversation
told how he and Jasniff and Poole had cut down
the tree and let it fall on the roadway, so that Dave
and Babcock had been pitched off their wheels, and
he also told of how Henshaw had been drugged
previous to the football game, and of several other
mean things that had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"And then to think that on top of it all you
saved my life," Plum went on. "Oh, Dave, I
can't understand it! You're the best boy
alive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I am not," answered Dave. "I've got
lots of faults of my own, Gus, lots of them!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you're not mean like me&mdash;and not dishonest.
I don't wonder the fellows like you."</p>

<p>At last they started back for the school, the snow
pelting them in the face as they journeyed along.
Each boy was busy with his thoughts and but little
was said. When they came in sight of the Hall
Gus Plum halted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't do it! I can't!" he almost sobbed.</p>

<p>"Come, I'll go with you to Dr. Clay," answered
Dave, and linked his arm in that of the other
youth. Thus they entered a side door and passed
directly to the office. Here, when confronted by
the master of Oak Hall, Gus Plum burst into bitter
tears and it was several minutes before he could
utter a word.</p>

<p>When the confession had been finally made Gus
Plum's face wore a more peaceful look than it had
for many a day. He kept nothing back, nor did
he try to defend himself in the least. He wanted
Dave to remain in the office and addressed his
words quite as much to his fellow student as to the
master of the Hall.</p>

<p>"I know I am not fit to remain here, Dr. Clay,"
he said at last. "And if you send me home I shall
not complain. But please don't hand me over to
the police! Anything but that!"</p>

<p>It was then that Dr. Clay spoke, and never had
Dave seen him more stern and at the same time
dignified. In well-chosen words he told Plum

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>

what he thought of his pupil's meanness and baseness.</p>

<p>"By your own confession, you acknowledge
doing things of which I did not dream a pupil of
mine could be guilty. You have endangered the
very lives of Porter and Babcock, as well as the life
of little Frank Bond. More than this, you have
been guilty of drinking and gambling, and you
have been the companion of common criminals.
And this on top of what happened last year!
Plum, I do not see how I can forgive you. You
have been a discredit to this school, and if I hand
you over to the police it will serve you right."</p>

<p>"Dr. Clay!" It was Dave who spoke. He
was filled with emotion that he could not suppress.
"Please don't do that! For my part, I am willing
to forgive Gus for what he did to me. Please
give him another chance, just one! If you hand
him over to the police you'll blast his reputation
forever!"</p>

<p>The doctor turned to the speaker in surprise,
and as Dave went on, pleading the cause of his
former enemy, the master's face gradually relaxed.
He sat back in his chair, folded his arms, and cast
a searching gaze on Gus Plum's pale, haggard
features.</p>

<p>"Plum, listen to me," he said, and now there was
a trace of kindness in his tones. "If I give you
one more chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Dr. Clay, if you'll do that!" sobbed the
boy, "I'll&mdash;I'll try to be better! I'll try to give up
my bad habits! I never realized until now how
really bad I have been! Just give me the chance,
and I'll be better! I'll do as Chip Macklin is
doing. Chip was never as bad as I've been, but
you know how he has changed. I want to do better&mdash;I
want to make something of myself, as Porter
is doing. Please give me one more chance!"</p>

<p>"I'll do it!" said the doctor, softly, almost
fatherly.</p>

<br /><br />
<span class="small">THE MEDAL OF HONOR&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="xlarge">Throughout</span></span> Oak Hall there was an air of
mystery that day. Gus Plum did not show himself
and Dave did not come to his class until after
dinner. When Dave did appear many wanted to
question him, but he evaded the crowd and took no
one but Roger into his confidence, although later he
told Babcock and Henshaw how Plum had confessed
to what had been done previous to the football
game.</p>

<p>"That was dastardly," said Babcock.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Dave. "But believe me, Plum
is suffering for it. He has a great deal on his
mind, and it will be a real act of charity on your
part if you forgive him. He has promised Dr.
Clay that he will reform, and I think we ought to
help him to do it."</p>

<p>"He can't reform&mdash;it isn't in him," said Henshaw,
promptly.</p>

<p>"I can't believe you," answered Dave. "If you
had seen what I saw you'd think better of Gus.
He has a good side to him as well as a bad side. I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>

am going to give him a chance and I hope all the
other fellows will too."</p>

<p>"But what is it all about?" insisted Buster
Beggs. "Jasniff?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jasniff is mixed up in it, and he did his
best to get Plum into a lot of trouble. Perhaps
you'll hear all about it some day. I have promised
to keep quiet, so I can't say anything,&mdash;and I don't
want to speak about it anyway," added Dave, with
feeling.</p>

<p>The snowstorm lasted for three days, and during
that time no word came in from the authorities
who were trying to catch Pud Frodel and his companion
in crime. The doctor had notified the
representatives of the law of the proposed meeting
at the old mill, and some officers had gone there,
only to find that the evildoers had changed their
plans.</p>

<p>It was hard for Dave to settle down to his lessons,
yet he did his best, for the examinations were
now close at hand and he still had his eye fixed on
the medal of honor. Plum came back to his class
and was a changed person. Whenever he recited
he did so in a low voice, and the minute he was dismissed
he disappeared, where, none of the pupils
seemed to know. He was occupying a small room
by himself and kept the door locked.</p>

<p>At last the storm cleared away and then came in
word that one of the men, the fellow called Hunk,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>

had been caught. He was closely questioned, and
being rather simple-minded, as previously mentioned,
said that Pud Frodel had gone to New
York, in company with Nick Jasniff. He said that
Jasniff was now hand-in-glove with Frodel, and
that the two were planning more mischief.</p>

<p>Upon this news Dr. Clay sent a cablegram to
Mr. Jasniff, who was in London, that Nick had
run away from school and also sent a letter of
particulars. Later word came back that Mr. Jasniff
would have a relative look for Nick and would
be back himself as soon as he could arrange certain
business matters.</p>

<p>At last came the day for the school examinations.
Dave was fully prepared for them, and when he
came out three points ahead of everybody else nobody
was surprised. Polly Vane stood second,
Roger fourth, Ben sixth, and Shadow eighth. Gus
Plum stood tenth, much to the surprise of many
who had imagined he would come out close to the
end.</p>

<p>"Dave Porter wins the medal of honor!" said
a dozen.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Dave!" cried Roger, and the
cheers were given with a will.</p>

<p>The medal was presented to Dave by the doctor.
The entire school was assembled for the occasion,
and Dr. Clay made a neat address, in which he
complimented the winner on the creditable showing
he had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am highly pleased to give Master David Porter
this medal," said the master of the Hall. "He
deserves it in more ways than one. Why, some
one else will tell."</p>

<p>And then, to the amazement of all, Gus Plum
got up from his seat, walked quietly but firmly to
the platform and faced his fellow students, his face
red but determined.</p>

<p>"I want to say a few words about Dave Porter,"
he said, looking around from one face to another.
"You all know me and you know how I have acted
towards Dave. Well, Dave saved my life, and
more than that, he has proved himself my best
friend. He stood by me at a time when I guess
every other fellow in the world would have turned
his back on me. That's why he deserves a medal
of honor,&mdash;and would deserve it even if he was at
the bottom of the class." Plum paused a moment.
"I ought not to speak about myself&mdash;I guess the
doctor didn't think I would. But I want to say
before you all that I am going to try to be different
from what I used to be. The doctor might have
sent me away from this school for what I did, but
Dave Porter spoke up for me, and now I am to
have another chance here&mdash;and I am going to
make the best of it. That's all."</p>

<p>Gus Plum bowed and walked back to his seat.
There were murmurs all around, and a few hisses,
but the majority of the students looked at Plum encouragingly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>

He kept his eyes down, looking at
nobody. Roger reached over and shook hands,
and then a number of others did the same.</p>

<p>"What Plum has said about Porter is strictly
true," said the doctor, coming forward again.
"Therefore I take the greatest of pleasure in presenting
the medal of honor to the winner, and with
it I wish him the best of luck throughout life!"</p>

<p>A cheer went up, in which Gus Plum joined
heartily. Then other prizes were presented, after
which school was dismissed for the day.</p>

<p>Plum's speech had a tremendous effect. All
wanted to know how Dave had saved his life and
the story had to be told over and over again. Little
was said about why the former bully had left
school that snowy morning, and the boys knew
enough not to ask too many questions.</p>

<p>"I really think he'll turn over a new leaf," said
Ben. "He seems to have awakened to a realization
of how he was drifting."</p>

<p>"I hope with all my heart he does try to do better,"
said Roger. "I am going to do as Dave is
doing&mdash;encourage him all I can." And then Ben
and a number of others said the same.</p>

<p>That day came a welcome letter from Phil Lawrence.
He was getting better rapidly now and expected
to come back to Oak Hall in a few weeks.</p>

<p>"This is glorious news!" cried Dave. "Poor
Phil! How he has suffered!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"And all for the glory of a football game," answered
Roger. "Pretty rough sport, no mistake
about it."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what makes it exciting," said Buster
Beggs.</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story," came from
Shadow. "A boy went to the country for his
health. After he had been there a week he wrote
to his mother: 'Having dead loads of fun. Fell
from the cherry tree and sprained my wrist, had
the bull horn me over a fence, got sick eating green
apples, and yesterday, when I fell in the well, I lost
the dollar pop gave me. Send another dollar and
it will be all right.'" And the usual short laugh
went up.</p>

<p>On Monday came in news that Pud Frodel
had been captured. It was also learned that
Nick Jasniff had sneaked on board of a steamer
and sailed for Europe. The next day Gus
Plum received a letter which he showed to
the doctor and to Dave. It ran in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You were a fool to go back on me. If you
had stuck to me we could have made a lot of
money. They are after both of the men, so I am
going to clear out. I've got several hundred dollars
and I expect to have a good time in Europe
on it."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>This communication was unsigned but was in
Nick Jasniff's handwriting. Gus Plum shivered as
he perused it.</p>

<p>"I am glad I did not stick by him," said he. "I
am sorry I ever had anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"His influence in this school was certainly very
bad," said Dr. Clay.</p>

<p>Later on the two men were tried and convicted,
and each received several years in prison as a punishment
for their crimes. Only a small amount of
the stolen goods was recovered, which made Mrs.
Fairchild, Mr. Lapham, and a number of others
mourn. Much to the surprise of everybody it
came out that Frodel and the other man had
robbed Roger while he lay unconscious at the
bridge and had also made off with his motor cycle.
They had wanted to pawn this, but had not dared,
and it was found where they had placed it, under
some hay in a barn near Oakdale. During the
trials Gus Plum was called as a witness for the
state to testify and did so, doing nothing to shield
himself. This was considered to his credit, and
when he returned to Oak Hall many thought more
of him than ever. There was now a coolness between
the former bully and Nat Poole, who seemed
to be left in the cold all around.</p>

<p>"I don't think we'll ever see anything more of
Jasniff," said Dave one day to Roger. But in this
surmise Dave was mistaken, and how will be related

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>

in another volume of this series, to be entitled,
"Dave Porter in the Far North; or, The
Pluck of an American Schoolboy." In this volume
we shall meet many of our friends again, and learn
what Dave did towards finding his father and his
sister who had so mysteriously disappeared during
their tour of Europe.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving was now at hand, and many of
the boys prepared to return to their homes for the
holidays. Dave was going to Crumville and so
was Ben. Roger was going home too, along with
Shadow and Buster Beggs and Sam Day.</p>

<p>"I am going to stop to see Phil," said Dave, and
Ben went with him. Phil was delighted over the
visit, and amazed to learn the news concerning
Plum and Jasniff.</p>

<p>"Dave, you're a dandy!" he cried. "You're
one boy in a thousand!"</p>

<p>"Say one boy in ten thousand!" answered Ben.</p>

<p>At this Dave smiled quietly.</p>

<p>"I only tried to do my duty," said he.</p>

<p>The homecoming was full of pleasure to the
boy, and here, for the time being, we will leave
Dave. He had won the medal of honor, and no
one begrudged him the pleasure it gave him to
wear it.<br /><br /></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
